00:00.700 --> 00:07.840
OK, so the final piece of the puzzle for the profile screen is for us to add a logout functionality.

00:07.870 --> 00:13.960
OK, so here in the view model, I want to create a function on logout.

00:15.700 --> 00:23.290
OK, and here I want to set everything or reset every, every piece of data that I have here in the

00:23.290 --> 00:23.800
view model.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.290
So I'm going to say asked Dot.

00:26.770 --> 00:31.000
Sign out, then sign then.

00:32.540 --> 00:35.480
Dot value equals false.

00:36.260 --> 00:41.270
OK, I'm going to set user data, dot value equals no.

00:43.370 --> 00:50.240
OK and pop up notification, that value is going to be an event.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.990
That will say logged out.

00:54.710 --> 00:58.010
OK, so that's pretty much it for the function.

00:58.280 --> 01:04.670
Now let's go back to our profile screen and we will update the call for the log.

01:05.450 --> 01:07.370
OK, so on logout here.

01:08.640 --> 01:16.620
We will simply call the M Dot on logout, so that basically should solve our problem.

01:17.730 --> 01:22.800
And then once we logout, actually, we need to navigate to some other screen.

01:22.860 --> 01:28.560
So here I'm going to say navigate to nav controller.

01:29.630 --> 01:33.320
And destination screen dot logging.

01:33.770 --> 01:39.590
So I want to navigate to the log in screen, so that should be basically enough.

01:40.490 --> 01:46.190
Let's go ahead and run and test our application and see if they log out functionality works as expected.

01:50.760 --> 01:58.650
OK, so I'm in my mind post page then in the profile, and if I click logout, I am logged out and sent

01:58.650 --> 02:00.720
back to the log in screen.

02:01.050 --> 02:11.280
And if I try to log in again, John at gmail.com one two three four five six, log in and then I'm sent

02:11.280 --> 02:15.180
back to my post page and then to profile.

02:15.450 --> 02:18.750
So that kind of completes the authentication loop.

02:18.750 --> 02:26.730
We have a log out functionality now as well, and we have profile or user information and the ability

02:26.730 --> 02:28.560
to update that as we want.

02:29.010 --> 02:29.800
So that's it.

02:29.820 --> 02:33.960
Thank you for watching so far, and I will see you in the next video.

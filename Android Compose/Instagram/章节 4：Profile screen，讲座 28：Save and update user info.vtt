00:00.390 --> 00:07.500
OK, so in this video, we're going to implement the on save functionality for our profile content.

00:07.800 --> 00:15.240
Now, luckily, we've put in pretty much all the work there is to it for this functionality since in

00:15.240 --> 00:17.910
our eye IG view model.

00:20.010 --> 00:25.870
OK, in our view model, we have a function called create or update profile.

00:26.140 --> 00:33.400
So what we want to do is we want to use this function to update our information for name, username

00:33.400 --> 00:34.330
and bio.

00:34.510 --> 00:40.420
We're not going to touch the image URL in this situation because we don't have an image URL yet.

00:40.690 --> 00:48.190
We just have these three fields that are updatable here name, username and bio.

00:48.790 --> 00:53.290
All right, so let's go ahead and implement that in our IG view model.

00:53.530 --> 00:57.520
I'm going to just create a public function down below.

00:57.940 --> 01:10.030
Fun update profile data that takes a name of type string, a username of type string and a bio of type

01:10.030 --> 01:10.510
string.

01:12.410 --> 01:16.050
And this one simply calls create or update profile.

01:16.070 --> 01:21.710
Now this is a private function, and I'm going to leave it like that simply because this contains the

01:22.310 --> 01:30.410
business functionality that we don't want really to expose to our users.

01:30.590 --> 01:38.450
If we extend the application, then you know, it's safer to separate the public function from the private

01:38.600 --> 01:39.320
operation.

01:39.830 --> 01:47.150
So I'm going to use this create or update profile call, and I'm going to say name, username and bio.

01:48.650 --> 01:56.930
OK, so we have that now let's go to our profile in unsafe, we're going to save GM Dot, what did we

01:56.930 --> 01:57.420
call it?

01:57.440 --> 02:03.740
Update profile data with name, username and bio.

02:05.120 --> 02:05.470
OK.

02:05.990 --> 02:15.500
So that's pretty much all we need to do that should update our information in the backend Firebase UI

02:16.550 --> 02:17.040
API.

02:17.060 --> 02:17.290
Sorry.

02:17.510 --> 02:21.900
So let's go ahead and run the code and test out our new functionality.

02:21.920 --> 02:27.910
Let's see if we actually get some new data in the backend firebase.

02:27.940 --> 02:34.160
So here I have my user, Johnny John, as a username and bio.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.750
So let's have a look.

02:36.560 --> 02:42.470
Now, edit profile the name, let's change that to John.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.080
Username John Wick.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.990
And this is the account of John Wick.

02:55.590 --> 02:56.160
Why not?

02:56.910 --> 02:59.250
All right, so let's go ahead and save.

02:59.970 --> 03:04.350
We get the spinner and you can see here that the information has been updated.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.990
John John Wick and the bio.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.300
So that is basically all there is to it.

03:09.300 --> 03:17.670
Since we've already done the work to update this firestorm information than simply calling the function

03:17.670 --> 03:20.850
and getting the new data is all we need to do here.

03:21.180 --> 03:28.170
So that's it for this video in the next one, I think we will work a bit on the user image since we

03:28.170 --> 03:31.650
want to be able to upload an image for our user.

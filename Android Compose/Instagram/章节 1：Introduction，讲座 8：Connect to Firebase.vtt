00:01.450 --> 00:08.860
In this video, we're going to connect our project to Firebase so that we can use Firebase in our project

00:08.860 --> 00:09.640
as we need.

00:09.880 --> 00:15.320
Now before we do this, make sure you build or rebuild your project.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.080
OK, that's important for Firebase.

00:17.410 --> 00:21.160
And then once you've done that, go to tools and select Firebase.

00:21.580 --> 00:26.410
This will bring up the assistant that will make connecting to Firebase really, really easy.

00:26.440 --> 00:31.900
Otherwise, we need to create some manual JSON files, and that's a bit more complex.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.170
So I'm going to go to cloud the fire store.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.310
Click on, Get Started and then connect to Firebase.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.580
OK, so let's go ahead and click on that build.

00:44.540 --> 00:50.090
And we're just going to wait for the build to finish that should be quite quick.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.950
All right, once that is done, let's go ahead and connect to Firebase, and that will bring up the

00:55.950 --> 00:57.450
Firebase console.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.940
So here you're going to either create a new project or select an existing project.

01:02.940 --> 01:07.950
For me, I'm just going to select an existing project and connect to that.

01:08.070 --> 01:15.630
OK, so let's go ahead and we're going to wait for that to connect to our Android Studio.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.120
And then click on Connect.

01:20.900 --> 01:27.140
So that will connect our current project to the Firebase project on the backend API.

01:30.160 --> 01:37.690
If you are using a new project on Firebase, you need to enable the services that you are going to be

01:37.690 --> 01:38.170
using.

01:38.220 --> 01:44.890
OK, so for me, for example, I have my project here and I want to enable authentication.

01:44.890 --> 01:51.120
So here I want to set up a signing method and I want to use email and password.

01:51.130 --> 01:58.420
So go ahead and enable that and save so we don't need email link that just complicates our flow a little

01:58.420 --> 01:58.720
bit.

01:59.470 --> 02:03.460
You could implement this if you wanted to, but that just adds a bit more complexity.

02:03.460 --> 02:07.510
So we're just going to leave email and password and click on Safe.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.410
So that has enabled our email and password.

02:11.620 --> 02:14.860
We also need to enable fire stored database.

02:15.070 --> 02:17.260
OK, we're going to be using that in our code.

02:17.530 --> 02:25.210
So go ahead and create a database and we're going to start in test mode since we are kind of building

02:25.210 --> 02:26.770
our code and practicing.

02:27.370 --> 02:29.110
We are using test mode.

02:29.110 --> 02:35.260
If you want to publish your application, you need to set some rules regarding the database, so you

02:35.260 --> 02:36.880
would need to do production mode.

02:36.910 --> 02:39.220
But for us, we're just building our code for now.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.080
So we're doing test mode here.

02:41.650 --> 02:45.580
OK, so go ahead and click next and we're going to click Enable.

02:47.420 --> 02:55.670
OK, so we're just waiting for the firestorm to finish processing, and then we'll move on to enabling

02:55.670 --> 02:56.270
storage.

03:02.070 --> 03:07.290
All right, so that's all done, so this is the database that we're going to be using.

03:07.530 --> 03:10.800
And then we need to do the same thing for storage.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.540
OK, so now for me, this is enabled.

03:16.140 --> 03:17.410
There's nothing much to it.

03:17.430 --> 03:24.660
You just click use or whatever the name of the button is and you should have the system set up already.

03:24.960 --> 03:29.270
OK, for the rules, I think just the default is going to be fine.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.210
We're still doing in what they call here playgrounds.

03:33.210 --> 03:37.320
So basically testing and developing our app and not yet publishing it.

03:37.960 --> 03:43.170
You know, obviously for publishing an application, there's a lot more complexity that goes behind

03:43.170 --> 03:43.650
the scenes.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.750
So security and things like that.

03:46.380 --> 03:52.920
So if you do want to publish a large app, you do need to work with someone who is familiar or you need

03:52.920 --> 03:56.730
to get more familiar with the rules around Firebase.

03:56.940 --> 04:02.790
But for our purposes, we're just going to do the basic basic rules are fine.

04:02.850 --> 04:11.040
That is going to allow us to read, read and write to our database, to our storage and to our authentication.

04:15.060 --> 04:23.850
OK, now I can go back to my project and we can add the SDK to our project.

04:23.930 --> 04:28.680
OK, I think this should already be there most of it, but let's go ahead and accept the changes.

04:29.310 --> 04:33.360
We're going to sink and then wait for that to finish.

04:35.980 --> 04:44.050
That just basically adds Google services to our project and allows us to use Firebase and Firestorm

04:44.050 --> 04:44.860
in particular.

04:45.400 --> 04:45.770
All right.

04:45.790 --> 04:47.980
So that is mostly done.

04:47.980 --> 04:50.160
I think it just needs to download a couple of things.

04:51.440 --> 04:51.770
All right.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.450
That is basically it.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.600
Let's have a look here for storage.

04:57.050 --> 04:58.010
It is connected.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.320
Let's add cloud storage as well.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.510
I think that should be already there.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.420
OK, so let me just open up the app.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.670
And yes, we have fire store.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.770
We have storage and we have authentication.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.120
So that should be fine.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.130
We are done with this.

05:13.310 --> 05:20.450
Now we're not going to follow the rest of the assistant steps simply because we will implement them

05:20.450 --> 05:21.250
in a different way.

05:21.260 --> 05:28.100
We're going to use hilt to implement them, not directly in our main activity, as the assistant says.

05:28.340 --> 05:29.920
So don't worry about that.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.410
We will do that later on in a better way.

05:33.440 --> 05:38.690
OK, we're not going to use this reference that the assistant recommends.

05:39.320 --> 05:39.650
All right.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.080
That's it for Firebase.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.590
I will see you in the next video.

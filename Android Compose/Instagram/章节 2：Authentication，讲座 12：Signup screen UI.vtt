WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:06.330
In this video, we're going to start to put in place the sign up screen layout.

00:06.390 --> 00:11.670
OK, so we're not going to retouch the functionality that much, but we're just going to implement the

00:11.670 --> 00:15.720
layout of the composable of sign up screen.

00:16.260 --> 00:16.580
All right.

00:16.590 --> 00:18.600
So open up sign up screen.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.130
The sign up screen file.

00:20.550 --> 00:25.850
Let's remove the text that is there and we're going to put a few elements on our screen.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.790
So first of all, I would like to put a Instagram logo at the top.

00:30.390 --> 00:37.950
Then we're going to add the username, the email and the password, and we're going to have a button

00:38.280 --> 00:41.160
to actually perform the signing.

00:41.550 --> 00:47.490
And of course, we need to have a link to the log in screen in case the user already has an account

00:47.490 --> 00:49.140
but just wants to log in.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.060
OK, so let's go ahead and do that.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.820
So I'm going to put here a box.

00:53.820 --> 01:03.720
First of all, now the modifier is going to be modifier dot filled max size and inside my box I want

01:03.720 --> 01:04.920
to put a column.

01:06.910 --> 01:14.540
And here I will have a modifier equals modifier dot fill.

01:14.590 --> 01:15.910
Max width.

01:17.770 --> 01:24.520
OK, I want to dart wrap content, height.

01:25.760 --> 01:34.970
OK, I just want the height of the elements and dot vertical scroll, and here I will have remember,

01:35.420 --> 01:36.530
scroll state.

01:37.790 --> 01:38.130
All right.

01:38.150 --> 01:44.540
So I want to remember that scroll state in case we are our application is destroyed and recreated.

01:45.350 --> 01:53.960
Now here inside, I'm going to have three states, so I'm going to have a valid username state that's

01:53.960 --> 01:54.540
going to be.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.430
Remember?

01:56.580 --> 02:00.210
Of let's import that, remember.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.210
Actually, we can put remember savable here.

02:05.150 --> 02:08.330
And right, remove that.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.560
So remember, savable of mutable state of.

02:14.120 --> 02:18.260
And here we will have a text field.

02:19.340 --> 02:19.970
Value.

02:21.810 --> 02:26.130
OK, so we're going to use this state in our username tax field.

02:26.220 --> 02:32.860
Remember savable, I'm going to duplicate that twice commandes the on my Mac, it's controlled the,

02:32.880 --> 02:34.230
I think, on a PC.

02:34.710 --> 02:40.060
In any case, user name state, the second one is going to be email state.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.980
OK, I think the rest is the same.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.180
And then we're going to have pass state for the password.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.040
All right.

02:50.050 --> 02:51.630
So I have my three states.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.490
Let's go ahead and put some elements on the screen.

02:55.500 --> 03:04.440
So first of all, I would like to have an image with a painter that's going to be painter resource.

03:05.580 --> 03:13.470
And you will find if you downloaded the images attached to the Create Project lecture, you will have

03:13.560 --> 03:15.290
an IG logo here.

03:15.310 --> 03:20.250
Okay, so we're going to use that for our logo here at the top of the screen.

03:20.610 --> 03:23.110
So it is going to be ah.

03:23.940 --> 03:31.100
Now, when you import this AR function, our class, make sure you import the one from your project,

03:31.110 --> 03:35.160
OK, so that we can have access to our jobs.

03:35.160 --> 03:43.230
So our dot drobo dot IG underscore logo and description is going to be no.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.180
Now, I'm just going to need a modifier here.

03:50.310 --> 03:55.980
Modifier Dot, then he sort that format the code.

03:56.310 --> 04:02.180
All right, so the modifier, I'm going to have a width of 250 dots dpi.

04:02.220 --> 04:08.910
Make sure you import the dot DP dot padding is going to be six.

04:09.450 --> 04:13.080
Padding at the top is going to be 16 dot DP.

04:14.130 --> 04:19.560
And then the full padding is going to be eight dot DP.

04:20.830 --> 04:25.140
OK, let's reformat the code and we have a nice image.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.660
All right, so we have our image.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.730
Let's add a text.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.190
The text is going to be signed up.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.500
OK.

04:36.640 --> 04:41.830
The modifier is going to be modifier.

04:42.910 --> 04:46.710
Dot padding of eight dot deep.

04:48.410 --> 04:54.630
We're also going to have a font size of 30 dot SB.

04:55.460 --> 04:55.800
OK.

04:55.950 --> 05:02.030
Make sure you import the SB and then we're going to have a font family.

05:02.780 --> 05:07.610
Let's say something like font family dot sans serif.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.570
OK, format that code and we have a text.

05:12.320 --> 05:18.140
Now we're going to need a few elements for our username, email and password.

05:18.170 --> 05:22.820
So here I'm going to have an outlined text field.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.160
With the value is going to be username dot value.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.820
Oh, sorry, user name states don't value.

05:42.250 --> 05:45.070
Now there's a small issue here.

05:45.940 --> 05:53.620
OK, so my mistake mutable state of not set of immutable state of textual value.

05:53.650 --> 05:58.660
OK, so now we have our outline text field with the value on value.

05:58.660 --> 06:02.770
Change is going to be username states.

06:02.770 --> 06:04.990
The value is going to be it.

06:06.410 --> 06:14.240
OK, we're going to add a couple more things here, so we're going to have a modifier equals modifier

06:14.720 --> 06:19.580
dot padding is going to be a deep.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.690
And finally, we're going to have a label.

06:25.730 --> 06:28.940
And this label will have a text.

06:30.530 --> 06:33.770
With the text is going to be username.

06:35.060 --> 06:40.670
OK, let's reformat the code, so we have our username fields.

06:41.060 --> 06:44.570
OK, now we're going to need the exact same field two more times.

06:44.570 --> 06:51.380
So I'm just going to copy and paste this twice, and we're just going to change whatever needs changing

06:51.380 --> 06:51.680
here.

06:51.980 --> 06:55.190
So the second one is going to be instead of username.

06:55.490 --> 07:00.110
We're going to have our email states.

07:02.300 --> 07:02.810
OK.

07:03.470 --> 07:09.650
Email state, obviously we need to change or I need to change, you might have done this correctly.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.870
So email state emails.

07:12.890 --> 07:18.680
They don't value modifiers the same and then the label is going to be email.

07:20.030 --> 07:27.370
All right, and the final one is going to be pass state, passed state, and here we're going to have

07:27.440 --> 07:28.220
password.

07:28.820 --> 07:36.710
The final one needs another element here and that is going to be visual transformation simply because

07:36.710 --> 07:38.960
we need to hide the password.

07:38.990 --> 07:45.410
OK, so the transformation is going to be password visual transformation.

07:47.570 --> 07:47.960
OK.

07:48.410 --> 07:54.620
Let's reformat the code, so we have our three seals, I think those are correct.

07:55.550 --> 07:59.060
Email, email and pass pass password.

07:59.090 --> 08:00.950
All right, that looks good.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.490
Let's go ahead and create down below.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.060
We're going to add a button.

08:06.450 --> 08:10.200
And we're going to leave the oncolytic empty for now.

08:11.880 --> 08:12.360
OK.

08:12.930 --> 08:15.140
And we're just going to add a modifier.

08:16.710 --> 08:26.790
After the oncolytic, we're going to add a modifier is going to be modifier dot padding eight or deep,

08:27.900 --> 08:30.930
and then we have the on click.

08:31.950 --> 08:32.420
All right.

08:32.430 --> 08:38.580
And then inside the button, I'm just going to have a text that's going to say, Sign up.

08:40.350 --> 08:40.680
All right.

08:40.920 --> 08:41.940
That's looking good.

08:42.240 --> 08:48.480
So I have my button and I would like to have a link that takes me to the log in screen as well.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.670
So down below, I have a text.

08:51.030 --> 08:55.150
The text says already a user question mark.

08:55.620 --> 08:59.430
Go to log in and arrow.

09:00.030 --> 09:08.370
Now the text has a few elements here, so I'm going to have a color equals color dot blue.

09:10.400 --> 09:17.810
I will have a modifier modifier dot padding, eight dots deep.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.660
And dot clickable.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.230
And we're going to leave the quick, empty for now.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.210
And I'm going to reformat the code.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.160
So I think that is it.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.870
Unless I've made some mistake, then that should be fine.

09:31.890 --> 09:37.260
We're not actually using the NAF controller or the View model yet because we're not implementing the

09:37.260 --> 09:38.070
functionality.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.070
Let's just go ahead and run this and see what it looks like.

09:56.540 --> 10:04.100
OK, so I've made a small mistake here, actually, textual value cannot be remembered using remember

10:04.100 --> 10:09.110
savable, so we need to replace that with a simple remember.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.510
OK, so if we run that?

10:12.760 --> 10:14.920
Hopefully that will work this time.

10:20.090 --> 10:22.620
OK, so we have our screen.

10:22.640 --> 10:30.140
The only thing that I see is that we're not learning this correctly, so we need to put a alignment.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.360
So inside our column here.

10:32.780 --> 10:40.100
I'm going to have a horizontal alignment is going to be alignment dots centered horizontally.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.260
OK, so let's go ahead and run that.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.780
OK, so that is looking better.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.830
One thing I want to check when we open the keyboard.

10:59.310 --> 11:04.050
We need to be able to scroll up a bit because it covers some of our UI.

11:04.350 --> 11:06.830
So in order to address that, it's quite simple.

11:06.840 --> 11:12.690
Let's go in our Android Manifest file and down below in the activity.

11:13.020 --> 11:20.880
I'm going to add a window soft input mode and we're going to have adjust, resize.

11:20.910 --> 11:25.950
OK, so we're going to be able to scroll in this in this view.

11:26.430 --> 11:30.030
So that's going to be valid for all the screens in our UI.

11:31.320 --> 11:31.620
All right.

11:31.630 --> 11:32.640
So let's run that again.

11:41.450 --> 11:49.400
OK, so now if I type something here, I can also scroll the UI, which is really good, it's what we

11:49.400 --> 11:51.260
are aiming to do.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.040
All right.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.080
So that's it for the UI.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.280
In the next video, we will start to implement the functionality for this screen.

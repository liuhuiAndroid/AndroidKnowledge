00:00.390 --> 00:06.960
All right, so in this video, we're going to start to build our main screens of our API and we're going

00:06.960 --> 00:10.870
to start with a with the My Post screen.

00:10.890 --> 00:17.730
The reason for that is if we start with the feed screen, we need to have some posts in the backend

00:18.090 --> 00:22.890
API so that we can have something to display and the same for the search screen.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.400
We need to search through something.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.010
OK, we don't have that at the moment.

00:26.340 --> 00:33.720
So I think it's the best is the best idea to start with a my post screen that will allow us to create

00:33.720 --> 00:38.940
new posts eventually and to edit our user information.

00:38.970 --> 00:39.330
OK.

00:39.570 --> 00:43.770
But for now in this video, we're just going to focus on the UI side of things.

00:44.340 --> 00:51.780
So I have here my post screen, and I'm just going to remove everything for now, and we will add this

00:51.780 --> 00:52.500
later on.

00:53.130 --> 00:59.940
So now let's go ahead and connect to our review model and retrieve a couple of elements that we will

00:59.940 --> 01:00.270
need.

01:00.360 --> 01:08.490
So first of all, I'm going to say Val user data is going to be VMM Dot user data dot value, and I

01:08.490 --> 01:10.710
will also need the spinner.

01:10.980 --> 01:19.080
OK, so I'm going to say Val is loading by spin or I mean the the flag that tells me if it's in progress

01:19.080 --> 01:24.150
or not so that I can display the spinning val is loading equals.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.230
VM in-progress dot value.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.160
All right, so let's go ahead and create a column.

01:32.850 --> 01:38.340
The reason I have this column is because I want to be able to display the spinner on top of whatever

01:38.340 --> 01:40.560
else will be there on the screen.

01:40.920 --> 01:49.530
So inside I'm going to have another column that will have a modifier dot weight of one s.

01:50.070 --> 01:57.030
So as you can imagine, this column will contain most of the UI and at the bottom we will have the navigation.

01:57.030 --> 02:00.960
So that's why we are taking up one f as a weight.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.780
So taking up the as much screen as we can, but leaving room for the bottom navigation.

02:07.530 --> 02:16.350
So here I will have a bottom navigation menu with bottom navigation item dot posts.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.730
So that is the selected item and the nav controller.

02:21.660 --> 02:24.300
OK, so I have my bottom navigation.

02:24.630 --> 02:27.000
Let's go ahead and build our UI.

02:27.270 --> 02:34.200
So first of all, I will have a row at the top that will contain my profile image, and it will tell

02:34.200 --> 02:36.960
me some information about the current user.

02:36.960 --> 02:42.960
So how many posts they have created, how many followers and followings there are?

02:43.320 --> 02:54.720
So I'm going to say Row, OK, inside I will have a profile image and here I will create this composable.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.790
Let's do that now, actually.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.730
So down below here, I'm going to have composable.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.640
And this is going to be fun.

03:06.660 --> 03:16.380
Profile image and the profile image will need a image you are of type string, okay?

03:16.770 --> 03:21.840
And an interaction we want to extract or hoist that state.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.730
So we're going to have an on click.

03:27.230 --> 03:29.060
Which is going to be a lander.

03:29.540 --> 03:36.020
OK, so we're not going to implement this now, we just want to define it so that we can have it here.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.360
OK, so that we can display it here.

03:38.810 --> 03:39.170
All right.

03:39.170 --> 03:44.120
So here I will have my profile image URL.

03:44.130 --> 03:48.400
So I'm going to say user data dot.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.520
I think it's a question mark dot image URL because that can be no.

03:53.540 --> 03:56.720
And we're going to have an on click OK.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.580
We're going to fill that in later on.

03:58.850 --> 04:01.520
But for now, we're going to add also a text.

04:02.570 --> 04:06.590
The text is going to be something like 15 posts.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.140
OK, let me add a splash in here so that it displays on two lines.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.390
OK, 15 posts.

04:14.390 --> 04:22.490
I'm going to have a modifier modifier dot weight of one if.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.990
And not a line alignment.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.890
Dart center vertically.

04:36.630 --> 04:41.070
OK, so I have my post, but I also want to add an alignment,

04:44.040 --> 04:46.760
a line text the line, that's it.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.880
Text align center.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.480
Sorry, text align center.

04:53.490 --> 04:53.850
OK.

04:54.090 --> 05:00.420
So basically this aligns the text in the row, and this aligns the text itself.

05:00.420 --> 05:07.020
So we want to be kind of in the middle of the composable of the text composable, right?

05:07.170 --> 05:14.910
So this puts the composable in the center of the row and this puts the text in the center of this element.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.730
Hopefully, that is clear.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.390
All right.

05:18.390 --> 05:23.850
So we're going to have two more of these because we want posts, followers and following.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.870
So I'm going to copy this twice.

05:30.250 --> 05:39.130
For the second, I'm going to say followers, so let's say 54 slash and followers.

05:40.780 --> 05:47.380
And for this one, ninety three and following.

05:49.570 --> 05:52.990
OK, so the people that are following this user.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.700
OK, so we have the top row.

05:58.390 --> 05:58.840
OK.

05:59.260 --> 06:06.970
So after that, we will add some information about the user, so we want to display the username.

06:07.690 --> 06:11.140
We want to maybe display the name of the user and the bio.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.040
OK, so let's go ahead and do that.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.530
We're going to add a column.

06:16.630 --> 06:18.820
OK, with a modifier.

06:20.540 --> 06:24.080
Dot padding of eight dpi.

06:26.300 --> 06:34.010
OK, import, that now valid username display is going to be.

06:35.280 --> 06:42.510
Now, if we have a username, if user data question my thoughts username.

06:45.410 --> 06:52.250
If that is no, then we display nothing else.

06:52.970 --> 07:02.420
We want to display an at sign before our user name, so at dollar curly braces user data.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.280
Question Mark.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.330
Username.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.570
OK, so we simply want to add an ad if we do have a username here.

07:12.050 --> 07:17.630
OK, so with that, we're going to add a text and the text is going to be user data.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.120
The question or thought name?

07:22.320 --> 07:22.800
OK.

07:24.930 --> 07:27.990
Or since this can be no or empty street.

07:28.620 --> 07:34.010
And importantly, I want to add a font weight here font weight dot bold.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.610
So I want the name to be in bold and the user name in regular text.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.790
Then we're going to display a text with user name display.

07:46.090 --> 07:54.370
OK, and another text with the bio, so we're going to say VM Dot, sorry, user data.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.830
Question Mark thought bio.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.610
And then Elvis operator, empty string, if that is no.

08:04.040 --> 08:09.080
OK, so we have our column for the user information.

08:09.440 --> 08:17.900
Next up, we want to display a button that will send us to the profile page where we can edit the information.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.550
OK, so let's go ahead and do that.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.790
We're going to add here and outlined button.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.660
OK, now for the UN click, we're not going to implement it at the moment, so then you remove it to

08:30.660 --> 08:34.380
do because it will just crash our application if we click it.

08:34.860 --> 08:40.560
So we're going to leave that on, click for now and we're going to add a modifier here.

08:43.030 --> 08:51.430
Modifier equals modifier dot padding is going to be eight dpi.

08:53.430 --> 08:56.490
And we're going to add Phil Max width.

08:58.270 --> 09:00.890
OK, so that's my modifier.

09:01.100 --> 09:08.600
Next up, I want to add some colors is going to be button defaults.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.520
Dot button colors.

09:19.310 --> 09:24.020
And here I will have a background color of color that's transparent.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.130
All right.

09:26.150 --> 09:28.370
So I want to have the transparent color.

09:28.760 --> 09:37.760
Now I would like to set the elevation is going to be button defaults, dot elevation.

09:40.660 --> 09:44.770
And here I will have default elevation of zero dpi.

09:45.730 --> 09:49.960
I will have pressed elevation zero dpi.

09:51.040 --> 09:58.630
And also disabled elevation zero dpi, so I want to make sure that I get no elevation on my button.

09:58.960 --> 10:09.550
And then finally, I'm going to have the shape is going to be rounded corner shape with 10 as the parameters.

10:09.550 --> 10:12.040
So I want corners to be rounded slightly.

10:13.560 --> 10:20.760
OK, and inside here, I'm going to have a text that says, edit profile.

10:22.710 --> 10:27.090
OK, let me add a color equals color dot black.

10:29.140 --> 10:39.250
OK, so we have our we have our button outline button that will eventually send us to the edit profile

10:39.250 --> 10:44.670
page, and here I will, and I would like to add a column for the post.

10:44.710 --> 10:50.560
We don't have any posts at the moment, but I just want to display that, that column, that information

10:50.560 --> 10:52.510
where we will eventually have some posts.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.380
So instead of column, I'm going to have a modifier.

10:58.770 --> 11:09.940
Modifier dot weight is going to be one F, and then here I'm just going to have a text that says Post's

11:10.710 --> 11:11.130
list.

11:11.460 --> 11:16.110
OK, so a column that takes up the rest of the space in that screen.

11:16.830 --> 11:21.020
So I think that is all we haven't implemented the profile image yet.

11:21.030 --> 11:22.470
We will do that in the next video.

11:22.740 --> 11:31.530
But for now, if we run this, we should be able to see kind of a nice outline for our for our UI.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.340
Let's have a look.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.000
OK.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.290
Moving to my posts.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.820
OK, so this is looking OK.

11:43.650 --> 11:46.860
Basically, we don't have too much information to fill out here.

11:47.070 --> 11:49.230
We haven't posted anything.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.300
We haven't created anything for the image.

11:51.300 --> 11:54.350
So that's why there's no image that appears here.

11:54.360 --> 12:00.390
We will do that in the next video, but here we have our posts, followers and following which we will

12:00.390 --> 12:01.410
fill out later on.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.020
Here we have some information for our users.

12:04.020 --> 12:11.280
So the username, we don't have a name or a bio yet, but we have the edit profile and the profile and

12:11.280 --> 12:12.420
the post list.

12:12.900 --> 12:22.020
If I go to the backend Firebase API and I fill out some information here for John, let's say the name.

12:24.830 --> 12:28.080
The name is going to be a strange journey.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.470
And then let's say the bio is also going to be a string.

12:34.250 --> 12:39.910
This is the IG account of Johnny.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.620
OK, so update that.

12:43.010 --> 12:46.060
Now let's go ahead and run the application again.

12:48.190 --> 12:51.640
And this time we should get some more information displayed.

12:53.880 --> 12:54.340
I'll say.

12:57.110 --> 13:02.990
There we go, so we have Johnny as the name at John and the bio displayed here.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.180
This button, of course, doesn't do anything.

13:05.480 --> 13:11.720
For now, we will implement that later and in the next video, we want to implement the image for the

13:11.720 --> 13:12.200
user.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.670
OK, we will do that next.

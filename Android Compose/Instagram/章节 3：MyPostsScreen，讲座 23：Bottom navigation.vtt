00:00.390 --> 00:07.080
Hello, everyone, welcome back to the course now in this video, we're going to implement some bottom

00:07.080 --> 00:10.710
navigation for the main part of our app.

00:10.740 --> 00:18.420
OK, so we will have basically three screens, one for the feed where we see different posts from different

00:18.420 --> 00:19.020
users.

00:19.260 --> 00:26.250
We have a search screen and we have a kind of a my posts page is not the profile page where we edit

00:26.250 --> 00:32.640
our personal information, but it's the one where we can create new posts for our account.

00:33.090 --> 00:39.180
Now in this video, we're going to focus on the bottom navigation and the issue that I have found while

00:39.210 --> 00:47.430
building this course and while building this application is that I think compose, jetpack compose and

00:47.430 --> 00:54.270
navigation doesn't work really well with the current iteration of bottom navigation.

00:54.310 --> 01:00.450
OK, so I've tried for a few days to make it work, but it seems to have some issues when you have an

01:00.450 --> 01:06.810
application that has both authentication with separate screens and screens with bottom navigation.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.540
So I've tried a lot of different things.

01:09.540 --> 01:17.340
I found too many issues, so I've decided to kind of build a custom bottom navigation functionality

01:17.340 --> 01:18.900
for this app in particular.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.090
So that's what we're going to do in this video.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.250
OK, we're going to build a custom bottom navigation functionality, which is actually quite easy to

01:26.250 --> 01:28.260
implement in jetpack compose.

01:29.070 --> 01:29.340
All right.

01:29.340 --> 01:35.400
So the first step that we need to take is we need to create these three screens that we want to display.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.050
We already have one of them.

01:37.050 --> 01:42.120
We have the feed screen and we will update this feed screen as well.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.550
But let's go ahead and create a couple more.

01:44.850 --> 01:51.480
So I'm going to create a new file, make sure it's a file, and I'm going to call this something like

01:51.480 --> 01:53.340
search screen.

01:55.400 --> 01:55.790
OK.

01:56.210 --> 02:07.010
And I'm going to just create the composable for now fun search screen, and I'm going to pass the nav

02:07.010 --> 02:14.510
controller and the view model of type I, the I view model.

02:15.290 --> 02:19.850
OK, we're going to just leave it empty for now because we will add stuff to it later on in this video.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.840
And also, let's go and get let's go ahead and create a new file.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.240
And this one is going to be my posts screen.

02:30.280 --> 02:39.820
And again, we're just going to add the composable fund my posts screen with the MAV controller and

02:39.820 --> 02:40.780
the VM.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.820
All right, so far, so good.

02:45.850 --> 02:51.940
Now we need to add this to our destination screens.

02:52.010 --> 02:56.950
OK, so in main activity in destination screen, we're going to add two more.

02:57.490 --> 02:59.070
So I'm just going to duplicate that.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.010
So this one is going to be search with the root search.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.790
And this one is going to be my posts.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.900
And my posts here, OK?

03:12.110 --> 03:16.060
And we need to add two more composable to Navajos.

03:16.070 --> 03:20.540
So one and two destinations green dot search.

03:21.740 --> 03:26.330
And here we have the composable that we've created search screen.

03:27.350 --> 03:27.890
OK.

03:28.400 --> 03:34.430
And here for the last one, we have my posts and the my posts screen.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.210
All right, so far, so good.

03:38.480 --> 03:43.010
Now let's go ahead and implement a bottom navigation.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.290
So for that, I'm going to create a new file here.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.100
And I'm going to call this bottom.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.840
Navigation menu, let's say.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.970
And that's going to be a file.

03:56.420 --> 04:01.160
So the first thing I need to do, I'm going to create an enum class bottom navigation.

04:03.590 --> 04:04.100
Item.

04:04.940 --> 04:13.520
OK, so this will contain the items that our bottom menu has, this will have a valid icon of type entry

04:14.480 --> 04:22.640
and a valid nav destination, which is of type of destination.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.140
Screen destination screen.

04:27.470 --> 04:32.990
And here we need to add three elements because we have three elements in our menu.

04:33.290 --> 04:37.700
Before we do that, let's go ahead and create three icons for this menu.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.080
OK, so in the drawer bowl, so under resource drawer bowl, I'm going to right click New Vector Asset,

04:45.920 --> 04:50.060
OK, and I'm going to select here a, let's say, home.

04:50.810 --> 04:53.060
And this will have the icon for home.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.640
OK, I'm going to call this.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.280
I see underscore home.

04:58.310 --> 05:02.360
This will correspond to the feed screen.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.760
OK, so I have I see home.

05:05.150 --> 05:09.230
Let's go ahead and create a new one, a vector asset.

05:09.830 --> 05:15.050
And here let's do search and we have a magnifying glass.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.360
I see search.

05:19.020 --> 05:19.840
Finished that.

05:20.160 --> 05:27.480
And finally, for my posts, we're going to have the kind of image of a user or a person, so let's

05:27.480 --> 05:28.590
search for person.

05:29.340 --> 05:34.040
I have the icon here and here I have I see posts.

05:35.370 --> 05:35.750
OK.

05:35.910 --> 05:37.940
Remember, this is different from profile.

05:37.950 --> 05:42.030
It's just the the screen where I create new posts.

05:43.200 --> 05:43.580
All right.

05:43.590 --> 05:45.760
So we have the icons.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.990
Now let's go and create the elements of this enum.

05:49.020 --> 05:50.880
So the first one is going to be feed.

05:51.480 --> 05:57.060
And here I will pass the ah dot drobo dot.

05:57.810 --> 05:59.700
I see underscore.

06:01.020 --> 06:05.700
I think it's home and we need to import the R class now.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.710
Be careful importing this.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.680
You need the one from your project.

06:10.720 --> 06:17.580
OK, you might import by mistake some other file, and the next destination is going to be destination

06:17.580 --> 06:18.870
screen dot feed.

06:20.590 --> 06:23.590
All right, so that's feed now for search.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.930
We have our dot draw bill.

06:28.190 --> 06:29.900
I need a comma at the end here.

06:30.560 --> 06:38.090
Draw bow dot by sea search and destination screen dot search.

06:39.660 --> 06:50.220
And then finally, I have posts with our the Drobo dots, I see posts and destination screen dot my

06:50.220 --> 06:50.730
posts.

06:52.550 --> 06:53.520
Okay, all good.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.640
Now we're going to create a composable.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.020
Fun bottom.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.720
Navigation menu.

07:05.010 --> 07:17.070
Now this is going to take a selected item of type, bottom navigation item and it's going to take a

07:17.070 --> 07:20.160
nav controller of type nav controller.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.750
So here I will have a row.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.630
We're now building the bottom navigation, right?

07:26.630 --> 07:33.200
So row, it's going to have a modifier modifier dot filled max width.

07:36.490 --> 07:41.170
OK, Phil Mack's with them dot rep content height.

07:42.860 --> 07:43.480
OK.

07:44.970 --> 07:47.390
That's what else we need, we need some padding.

07:48.830 --> 07:59.120
We're going to have a top party of four deep and I'm going to add a background of color thought white.

08:01.070 --> 08:09.440
OK, I need to import the DP, all right, so I have my row and inside this row, I need to pass the

08:09.440 --> 08:10.130
items.

08:11.990 --> 08:22.270
OK, so here I have four item in button navigation item dot values.

08:23.230 --> 08:32.560
So I'm going to take all elements from here and here I can see an image where the painter is painter

08:32.560 --> 08:36.250
resource and the ID is item the icon.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.870
The description is no.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.930
And I have a modifier.

08:47.080 --> 08:47.580
OK.

08:48.460 --> 08:53.080
Dot size, first of all, the size is going to be 40 dpi.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.900
The padding is going to be five dpi.

09:00.520 --> 09:09.880
Then the wait is going to be one f, so I want all the images to take up the same amount of space,

09:09.880 --> 09:11.920
so I'm just going to add one to all of them.

09:12.280 --> 09:20.230
And then finally, it's going to be clickable and when we click it, we're going to navigate to nav

09:20.230 --> 09:20.890
controller.

09:23.380 --> 09:24.850
And item.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.560
Dot destination.

09:29.840 --> 09:30.950
OK, easy enough.

09:31.280 --> 09:38.000
And then I want to add another thing, which is a color filter, and this color filter will basically

09:38.000 --> 09:42.290
depend if we're on the selected item or not.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.310
I misspelled this.

09:43.610 --> 09:47.600
So if we're on the selected item, I want to add a black color.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.780
Otherwise, this is going to be a gray color.

09:51.200 --> 10:00.020
So we can say if item equals selected item, then color filter.

10:02.240 --> 10:08.750
Dots tent is going to have a color dot black health.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.720
Color filter.

10:14.650 --> 10:18.790
Actually, we can change this a little bit, we can put it right, you know what, let's leave it like

10:18.790 --> 10:19.060
this.

10:19.240 --> 10:24.220
So color filter dot tint colored dot grey.

10:25.390 --> 10:29.080
So you can reduce this by putting the if inside the color filter dot tint.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.050
But you know, it's pretty much the same thing.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.110
Let me put this down here.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.140
OK.

10:36.160 --> 10:45.180
So I think that is all for the navigation menu, so we can now use this navigation menu in our screens.

10:45.190 --> 10:47.920
So let me open up feed screen.

10:48.910 --> 10:56.140
And instead of this text, I can add a couple of things, so I want to add a column that will fill up

10:56.140 --> 10:56.740
the screen.

10:58.630 --> 11:03.940
OK, so modifier equals modifier dot fill max size.

11:04.780 --> 11:14.030
OK, and inside here I want to have a bottom navigation menu with the selected item.

11:14.050 --> 11:19.120
Bottom navigation item, dot feed and map controller.

11:19.630 --> 11:24.070
Now, if we leave it like this, this will simply be at the top of the screen.

11:24.070 --> 11:32.590
So I want to have a column inside my column that will basically take up the whole space apart from the

11:32.590 --> 11:35.530
navigation menu, so it will put the navigation menu at the bottom.

11:36.010 --> 11:41.230
So Modifier equals modifier Dot's weight.

11:43.130 --> 11:49.670
One, if and inside this column, let's just put a text so that we have just another confirmation that

11:49.670 --> 11:52.070
we are on the feed screen.

11:53.590 --> 11:58.600
OK, so that will basically have a column that will take up the most of the space with a screen, with

11:58.600 --> 11:59.260
a text.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.870
And at the bottom, we have our navigation.

12:02.680 --> 12:09.820
OK, so I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to put it in the search and let's just modify the

12:09.820 --> 12:10.930
selected item.

12:10.930 --> 12:15.490
Here is going to be search and the text is going to be search screen.

12:16.840 --> 12:29.530
The rest stays the same and I have my posts again, paste that my this posts and my posts screen.

12:30.820 --> 12:31.240
OK.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.270
And I think that is sufficient.

12:35.260 --> 12:41.890
Basically, the system will send us to the feed screen and the feed screen will have a bottom navigation

12:41.890 --> 12:44.380
that we can use to navigate between the different screens.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.790
So let's go ahead and run this application and see what we get.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.980
All right, so the application is running now.

13:04.940 --> 13:08.390
I may have let me just check the ITV model.

13:08.720 --> 13:14.030
Yes, we have sign out, so I'm just going to comment this out for the next one, but for now, I'm

13:14.030 --> 13:15.590
just going to go with Alex.

13:15.740 --> 13:16.550
Or is it John?

13:16.550 --> 13:19.720
I think it's John gmail.com, the user.

13:19.730 --> 13:23.450
The user name doesn't matter at the moment unless logging.

13:24.200 --> 13:29.360
And that's just send us to the feed screen and we should see a confirmation text here.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.000
There we go.

13:32.030 --> 13:34.940
Log in success, we might want to remove that at some point.

13:35.270 --> 13:38.660
Feed screen and we have our bottom navigation view.

13:38.780 --> 13:44.720
So if I click on search, that will send me to the search screen and you can see that the color has

13:44.720 --> 13:47.900
turned to black here and the rest is gray.

13:48.170 --> 13:53.780
OK, so again, here the color is different when I move to a different screen.

13:55.130 --> 13:59.360
OK, before we end, let me just remove that log in successful.

13:59.360 --> 14:04.820
So in the view model, log in success.

14:05.030 --> 14:09.030
I'm just going to comment this out because we don't really need it.

14:09.050 --> 14:12.770
We get the confirmation that it's successful when we move to the correct screen.

14:13.580 --> 14:13.940
All right.

14:13.940 --> 14:20.600
So that is all for this video and in the next two videos, we're going to start to implement some Instagram

14:20.600 --> 14:22.020
specific functionality.

14:22.040 --> 14:22.760
I will see you there.

Before we move on with the course, I want to take a brief moment to let you know about something important

00:06.190 --> 00:09.470
on Udemy, and that is the review system.

00:09.490 --> 00:15.020
Now the Udemy marketplace is very competitive and it takes a lot to make a good course.

00:15.040 --> 00:22.050
Therefore, Udemy periodically asks you for reviews and that is completely out of the control of Udemy.

00:22.060 --> 00:25.990
Instructor So myself, I have no control over that now.

00:25.990 --> 00:33.160
Personally, I always strive for a five star course and in fact any review that is less than five stars

00:33.160 --> 00:38.110
is generally bad for a course standing on Udemy, which means Udemy promotes it.

00:38.110 --> 00:40.150
Less and fewer students see it.

00:40.420 --> 00:47.140
So I just want to invite you that if you dislike something about my course, please send me a message

00:47.140 --> 00:50.500
and let me know if I can change the course and improve it.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.280
I will.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.930
And I want to earn your five star reviews with all my courses.

00:56.350 --> 01:02.680
If you enjoy the course, however, and you feel you are ready, please consider reviewing it positively.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.450
It really helps out a lot.

01:04.960 --> 01:05.830
Thank you so much.

01:05.830 --> 01:08.320
And now let's get back to the course content.

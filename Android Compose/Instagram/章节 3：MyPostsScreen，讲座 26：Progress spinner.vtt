One thing that I would like to add to this profile, this my posts page or screen is that when we first

00:08.520 --> 00:13.440
arrive at this screen, we want to display a spinner while the image is loading.

00:13.680 --> 00:19.710
Keep in mind that we have accessed here the is loading flag, but we haven't actually used it.

00:20.070 --> 00:27.750
So what I would like to do is I would like to go in the my post screen composable at the end, I'm going

00:27.750 --> 00:30.690
to add and if is loading.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.420
I'm going to add a common progress spinner.

00:36.960 --> 00:44.010
OK, so we wanted this play a common spinner, if the flag is loading and when that is said to false,

00:44.010 --> 00:46.410
then that will not be shown.

00:46.770 --> 00:55.410
And in order to see this better, I'm going to go to my main common bits here in cheek, signed in and

00:55.410 --> 01:03.270
I'm going to change the destination from feeds to my posts so that we go straight to the screen and

01:03.270 --> 01:04.890
we see the spinner more clearly.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.690
So let's go ahead and run this.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.740
And hopefully, we will end up on the screen with kind of a spinner happening while it's retrieving

01:13.740 --> 01:14.340
some data.

01:16.810 --> 01:21.820
OK, so the data, I think, is already there because we get the information here, but the spinner

01:22.060 --> 01:27.580
is happening in the background while the data is being retrieved by the view model.

01:27.610 --> 01:34.650
OK, so we have now as spinner as well to tell the user that something is happening in the background

01:34.660 --> 01:39.160
if that takes a bit longer to retrieve to show the information.

01:39.970 --> 01:40.340
All right.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.500
That's it for this video.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.790
I will see you in the next one.

All right, in this video, I want to give you a quick overview of how to build and run and test your

00:08.360 --> 00:09.050
application.

00:09.260 --> 00:18.290
So here we have our devices, OK, I'm going to be using an emulator for this course simply because

00:18.470 --> 00:26.150
using a physical device is not really is not really easy to record what's going on so you can use a

00:26.150 --> 00:26.930
physical device.

00:26.930 --> 00:28.190
In fact, they do recommend it.

00:28.430 --> 00:36.570
If you use an emulator, make sure that you create an emulator that has this Play Store button.

00:36.590 --> 00:42.890
OK, because this will make it a bit more realistic and allow us to kind of download whatever we need,

00:42.890 --> 00:44.870
and it just works better.

00:45.050 --> 00:51.050
Now, I've had a few issues with the emulator while building this course, and especially I'm using

00:51.050 --> 00:53.300
the Nexus 5X API 30.

00:53.510 --> 00:57.530
There's a few connection issues and, you know, various problems.

00:58.010 --> 01:06.530
So if you can use your physical device connected to your laptop and it works much better or you can

01:06.530 --> 01:12.680
use an emulator as well, just make sure that you have the patience for the inevitable bugs that do

01:12.710 --> 01:13.100
happen.

01:13.670 --> 01:14.010
All right.

01:14.030 --> 01:18.110
Now, once you have that emulator, here is my suggestion.

01:18.110 --> 01:25.280
We will need a few photos for our post and our profile images.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.580
So I have already downloaded some images here.

01:28.820 --> 01:35.450
You can see I have a bunch of cities, I have some profile photos and some animals as well.

01:35.690 --> 01:38.780
So I do encourage you to download these as well.

01:39.560 --> 01:46.610
The way I downloaded the profile images is I go to this website called This is not.

01:48.190 --> 01:56.080
Is not a real person, which is a website that basically generates AP photos.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.580
What is the name of that?

02:01.010 --> 02:02.870
Oh, this person does not exist, that's the one.

02:03.710 --> 02:04.760
This person.

02:06.140 --> 02:09.290
Does not exist, that's the website.

02:09.620 --> 02:17.480
And this one basically is provides you with air generated spaces that you can then use as your image

02:17.480 --> 02:19.760
without any copyright problems like that.

02:19.770 --> 02:27.560
So every time you refresh that, it will give you a new face completely random so you can use that.

02:27.770 --> 02:35.660
You can download images of cities or animals or whatever you like to use, as you know, as your images

02:35.660 --> 02:37.790
for the post while we are developing this course.

02:38.360 --> 02:47.060
Also inside the project, I have downloaded a guy photo just for the kind of mock data that we're going

02:47.060 --> 02:54.560
to be using at the beginning, and I have downloaded an image of Tokyo also for the mock images that

02:54.560 --> 02:56.670
word will be using for the posts.

02:56.700 --> 03:02.120
OK, so go ahead and download those and put them in the drawer folder as well.

03:02.870 --> 03:03.230
All right.

03:03.290 --> 03:04.420
So that's it.

03:04.430 --> 03:06.320
I think that's all I wanted to cover.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.960
So emulator, be careful with that.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.310
There's bugs and it's better to use the physical device if you can.

03:13.610 --> 03:22.070
If not, use an emulator with the Google Play Store button and in the emulator to download the images.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.380
OK, so that's basically it.

03:25.070 --> 03:27.740
I think we can start in the next video.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.650
We can start to actually build our project.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.050
OK, we will start with setting the foundations.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.970
I will see you in the next video.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to this course on building an Instagram like application for Android.

00:07.600 --> 00:13.660
Now in this first video, I want to give you a quick overview of what we're going to be building and

00:13.660 --> 00:16.150
how this is basically going to work.

00:16.150 --> 00:21.910
So we're going to use a lot of cutting edge technologies to build this application.

00:21.910 --> 00:28.630
We're going to use Jetpack Compose, which was released quite recently by Google.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.240
So we're going to use it by compose.

00:30.250 --> 00:37.270
We're going to use NVMe for the architecture and we're going to use Firebase for the backend.

00:37.570 --> 00:42.910
OK, so that will allow us a lot of flexibility in building our application, but also it will allow

00:42.910 --> 00:45.310
us to scale the application if we want to.

00:45.360 --> 00:53.290
So after taking this course, if you want to scale this application, solidify it and publish it, then

00:53.290 --> 00:53.980
you can do so.

00:53.980 --> 00:58.090
But in this first video, I just want to give you a quick overview of what we're going to be building

00:58.090 --> 01:02.350
kind of the high level view of the screens that we're going to work with.

01:02.650 --> 01:06.760
So here we have our application that is running.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.010
So I have here a log in screen.

01:09.010 --> 01:15.520
Of course, log in will connect using Firebase authentication to the backend, and we can switch between

01:15.520 --> 01:18.460
a login screen and a sign up screen here.

01:18.790 --> 01:20.320
So let's go ahead and sign up.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.930
I'm going to create a username you can do.

01:23.140 --> 01:25.370
You can pretty much write anything you like.

01:25.750 --> 01:31.960
I'm going to have Kotlin because that's my name and cattle at Gmail dot com.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.410
Now, keep in mind, this is not a real email.

01:34.420 --> 01:37.300
This does not belong to me, so please don't send emails there.

01:37.750 --> 01:38.140
All right.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.790
And I'm going to set a password and I'm going to click Sign up now.

01:42.820 --> 01:51.850
This will communicate in the backend with the Firebase authentication to create the user and retrieve

01:51.940 --> 01:53.890
the data that we need.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.660
So here we have our basic UI, Instagram like UI.

01:58.870 --> 02:03.740
We have an image here at the top, which we haven't set yet, so it's going to be a default.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.680
Unknown user.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.360
And then we're going to have a feed.

02:07.360 --> 02:15.520
I've set here a few posts on our on our application just for show right now.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.050
Here we have a profile screen where we can go ahead and edit our profile.

02:23.230 --> 02:28.840
So here I can set a image, for example, I can choose this image here.

02:35.220 --> 02:43.080
And that has been saved on our fire based storage, and now we have it India, so I can set my name

02:43.080 --> 02:45.960
here and I set a bio.

02:45.990 --> 02:50.820
This is the profile of in.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.020
And I can put a.

02:55.410 --> 03:00.480
Icon here, OK, now I'm going to go ahead and save.

03:01.840 --> 03:07.810
All right, and if I go back, I have my profile, you can see here I have zero posts for now, I have

03:07.960 --> 03:10.090
zero followers and zero following.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.510
So in order to create a post, I'm going to click here.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.540
Then I'm going to select an image and.

03:17.730 --> 03:23.760
I'm going to select Bangkok, and I'm going to say Bangkok is awesome.

03:25.370 --> 03:25.970
Let me just.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.740
All right, let me type that correctly.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.480
Awesome.

03:29.870 --> 03:34.130
OK, and I'm going to click Post now, that's going to upload, of course.

03:38.350 --> 03:44.890
And now I have my post now, of course, I can post more images or I can edit my profile.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.960
But let's have a look at other features.

03:46.970 --> 03:56.950
So for example, we have our home screen, which has a feed of basically of posts that have been posted

03:56.950 --> 03:58.930
in the last 24 hours.

03:59.200 --> 04:05.290
Now this will contain basically all the posts as long as I'm not following anybody, right?

04:05.290 --> 04:12.790
So I have zero zero followers at the moment, so I will see kind of a generic post feeds here.

04:13.030 --> 04:19.000
But if I go, for example to this post in particular, I can follow Alex.

04:19.480 --> 04:19.960
OK.

04:20.860 --> 04:26.680
And then when I go back to my main screen, I only see the posts from my followers.

04:27.310 --> 04:34.260
OK, so here if I go to my profile, I have one following and the same goes for the followers.

04:34.270 --> 04:37.300
If somebody follows me, I will have this updated here.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.440
Now what else can we do?

04:39.460 --> 04:40.570
We can like a post.

04:40.570 --> 04:42.250
So for example, I like this post.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.010
I'm going to double click on it and I have my like.

04:45.010 --> 04:47.620
If I double click again, I will unlock it.

04:47.770 --> 04:55.180
OK, so if I double click like if I do a single click here, I will move to a post screen where I can

04:55.180 --> 04:56.650
see my likes.

04:57.010 --> 05:01.120
I can see the comment for that post.

05:01.390 --> 05:03.010
And also, I have my comment.

05:03.010 --> 05:08.230
So if I go ahead and comment something, Tokyo is cool.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.650
OK, I comment that I see my comment appear here.

05:13.950 --> 05:20.280
And if I go back, OK, I can see that we have a comment and a light.

05:20.610 --> 05:20.940
All right.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.350
Let's go back.

05:24.070 --> 05:24.490
All right.

05:25.090 --> 05:34.030
And again, I have another screen here for searching, so if I search for city search that I get a list

05:34.030 --> 05:38.380
of POWs now here we can have as many posts as there are in the backend.

05:38.650 --> 05:41.790
This is a scrolling list.

05:41.800 --> 05:47.890
OK, so if the posts do not sit on the screen, you will be able to scroll up and see all the posts.

05:48.280 --> 05:54.880
And here, of course, if I click on a post, then I have the information for that particular post.

05:55.150 --> 05:58.420
OK, I have here, Maria, which I can follow.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.160
And then I can go back and I have now two followers.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.910
So this is the main structure for our application.

06:07.300 --> 06:14.680
This looks quite simple from kind of an overview perspective, but it will involve quite a lot of technology

06:14.680 --> 06:15.580
behind the scenes.

06:15.610 --> 06:21.520
OK, so like I said, we will work with Jetpack Compose, so you will get a very, very good idea of

06:21.520 --> 06:24.100
how Jetpack Compose works in an application.

06:24.400 --> 06:30.010
You will see how we integrate just by compose with an empty VM architecture, so you will rely on a

06:30.010 --> 06:33.790
view model to kind of give us all the data.

06:34.330 --> 06:37.650
And then of course, we will work with Firebase.

06:37.660 --> 06:45.400
OK, so we will see Firebase authentication, storage and fire store for kind of the database side of

06:45.400 --> 06:45.820
things.

06:46.150 --> 06:51.370
So a lot of technologies, a lot of screens, a lot of functionality, and we will go through it step

06:51.370 --> 06:56.440
by step and hopefully you will learn a lot in this course and you will get a lot of value from it.

06:56.770 --> 06:59.950
So that's it for the first video, I will see you in the next one.

00:00.600 --> 00:06.540
The next thing I would like us to do is I would like us to put a spinner to kind of show the user that

00:06.540 --> 00:13.320
something is happening in the background, OK, and for that, we have the perfect site here in progress.

00:13.350 --> 00:20.790
OK, so if we are in progress, if this flag is set to true, then we can show kind of a spinner on

00:20.790 --> 00:22.200
the Sign-Up screen.

00:22.830 --> 00:23.130
All right.

00:23.130 --> 00:25.270
So that will be quite easy to do.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.150
First of all, let's create the spinner.

00:28.050 --> 00:33.450
And since we're going to use this spinner in multiple locations throughout our application, I'm going

00:33.450 --> 00:39.030
to put it here in the main common bits file and I'm going to create a composable here.

00:39.660 --> 00:43.470
OK, so we're going to call this fun something like common spinner.

00:46.050 --> 00:55.230
Let's say common progress spinner, OK, so we're going to just show a progress spinner whenever we

00:55.230 --> 00:56.880
do something in the background.

00:57.300 --> 01:02.310
Now here I'm going to create a row and a modifier.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.130
Dot.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.980
So first of all, we're going to add some alpha.

01:11.010 --> 01:20.370
I want it a bit transparent, so I'm going to say 0.5 f, then I'm going to add a background color dot

01:20.370 --> 01:21.300
light gray.

01:21.960 --> 01:27.000
Okay, so kind of a light gray, transparent color dot clickable.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.140
So I want to intercept all the clicks.

01:30.150 --> 01:37.710
OK, so I don't want the user to be able to do anything with the UI while the spinner is go is on the

01:37.710 --> 01:38.100
screen.

01:38.550 --> 01:42.720
So I'm going to set clickable enabled equals false.

01:43.650 --> 01:46.470
OK, and finally fill max size.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.830
OK, so the spinner is basically going to fill the maximum size and we're going to limit that depending

01:52.830 --> 01:57.330
on the situation, on the element where we are in the application.

01:58.140 --> 01:58.440
All right.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.390
So that is our modifier.

02:02.400 --> 02:10.860
Now we need to add a horizontal arrangement equals arrangement center and also a vertical alignment,

02:11.250 --> 02:13.470
also alignment center vertically.

02:14.010 --> 02:19.140
OK, we want the spinner right in the middle of whatever element we are displayed on top.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.850
And here I have a circular progress indicator.

02:24.690 --> 02:27.570
OK, that's a standard composable.

02:28.200 --> 02:34.590
So basically, this will display a spinner on top of whatever element we would like, and we're going

02:34.590 --> 02:36.600
to add it to our sign up screen.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.840
So here I'm going to add it right below.

02:41.410 --> 02:47.560
Right below this column, but still inside the box, the box is meant to allow us to put something on

02:47.560 --> 02:48.700
top of this column.

02:48.730 --> 02:52.600
OK, so here I'm going to have VAR.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.750
Val Val is loading.

02:57.600 --> 03:06.420
Is going to be VMD, not in progress, the value that we're going to have an if is loading, then I'm

03:06.420 --> 03:09.090
simply going to display the common progress spinner.

03:10.850 --> 03:18.290
And that's pretty much all there is to it, so we just display it here inside our box that is filled

03:18.290 --> 03:21.020
max size, so the spinner will basically cover the whole screen.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.540
So let's run the application and test it out.

03:39.410 --> 03:46.040
OK, so that is running, you already saw the spinner kind of running there while we were retrieving

03:46.040 --> 03:48.170
the data from the backend API.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.810
Now let's go ahead and create a new user.

03:50.810 --> 03:58.820
So let's say a b c a b c at Gmail dot com one two three four five six.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.990
OK, so if I sign up, I have the spinner in the foreground and then it is.

04:06.350 --> 04:09.370
It has processed something in the backend.

04:09.380 --> 04:15.470
We don't see any result on the UI because we haven't implemented that yet, but we can see it in the

04:16.400 --> 04:19.430
in the Firebase console like we have previously.

04:19.670 --> 04:22.310
So we know that this is working and now we have a spinner.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.810
All right, that's it for now.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.460
I will see you in the next video.

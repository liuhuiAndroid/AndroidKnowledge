WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:05.220
OK, so let's go ahead and implement our log in screen UI.

00:05.940 --> 00:11.130
All right, we're going to keep this for a little bit because we're going to use it actually in our

00:11.130 --> 00:11.610
UI.

00:11.820 --> 00:18.300
So first of all, at the top here, we're going to put a box so that we can overlap several elements

00:18.540 --> 00:23.520
and we're going to have a modifier modifier, dot filled max size.

00:24.450 --> 00:24.820
All right.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.670
Inside, we're going to have a column.

00:27.420 --> 00:34.170
So it's going to be quite similar in layout to our sign up screen, except we're going to have fewer,

00:35.010 --> 00:36.930
you know, boxes where you can.

00:36.960 --> 00:42.270
We don't need the I think we don't need the username, but we still need the email and password.

00:42.630 --> 00:51.420
So for the column, I'm going to have a modifier equals modifier dot fill max width, OK?

00:51.990 --> 00:56.100
We're going to have dot rep content size.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.760
Still in the modifier, though.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.500
Dot rap content size.

01:04.090 --> 01:08.890
Sorry, rap content, height and dot, vertical scroll.

01:10.150 --> 01:10.900
Remember?

01:13.270 --> 01:23.050
Scroll states, OK, so that will basically allow us to scroll when the keyboard is visible on the screen.

01:23.800 --> 01:30.640
Now we're going to declare two states so valid email states is going to meet, going to be remember.

01:33.630 --> 01:37.830
And here we have mutable state of.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.270
And we have a text field value.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.050
OK.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.430
So that is our email state.

01:52.460 --> 02:01.010
Let's duplicate that and I'm going to have a pass state, OK, so we just need email and password.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.390
We don't need the username.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.050
Now here at the top, of course, we're going to add the image.

02:08.330 --> 02:10.550
And painter resource.

02:12.340 --> 02:18.910
Of are now make sure you enable you import the correct answer for me, it's going to be this one, so

02:18.910 --> 02:22.630
the package name has to correspond to your application.

02:24.340 --> 02:36.280
OK, here you will find it at the top are Dot Draw Bowl Dot IG logo with a content description of No.

02:36.670 --> 02:41.950
And we can add our modifier equals modifier dot.

02:44.350 --> 02:46.270
Now, Dot with.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.460
Is going to be 250 dug deep.

02:52.850 --> 02:59.960
We're going to have padding is going to be top equals 16 deep.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.640
And we're going to have a regular putting of hate.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.780
So the only the top banning is different, the rest is the same.

03:09.410 --> 03:09.800
All right.

03:09.800 --> 03:14.360
So let's go ahead and add a text outside of the image.

03:16.040 --> 03:22.820
The text is going to be logging, and however, we're going to have modifier.

03:24.510 --> 03:29.490
Equals modifier dot padding of eight dpi.

03:31.590 --> 03:35.430
OK, what else do we need, we need a font size.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.580
Of 30, don't speak.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.480
And we will need a let's import DSP.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.050
And we will need font family.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.700
Font family thought serif.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.020
OK, we have our text, so we need to text fields.

03:56.890 --> 04:02.650
I'm going to actually copy those to text fields from the sign up screen.

04:03.430 --> 04:09.910
I'm going to copy the text fields, email and password, so copy those.

04:12.420 --> 04:12.940
All right.

04:12.960 --> 04:19.080
And I think those are the same, those are exactly the same because it's just email and password.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.930
And finally, we're going to need a button.

04:22.410 --> 04:24.420
So sign up screen button.

04:26.610 --> 04:29.100
I think that is exactly the same as well.

04:29.100 --> 04:29.380
So.

04:29.400 --> 04:36.670
Copy the button and we're going to paste it here, but we're going to remove the on click functionality.

04:36.690 --> 04:37.110
OK.

04:37.530 --> 04:42.750
For that, of course, we will need to contact the view model and call a different method.

04:43.230 --> 04:46.020
The name here is going to be the text here is going to be different.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.360
This is going to be logging.

04:53.600 --> 05:00.140
One thing I forgot in sign up screen as well is I would like to when when we click the button, I would

05:00.140 --> 05:02.660
like to dismiss the keyboard.

05:03.020 --> 05:09.440
OK, so for that, we need to add at the top here we need to add a valve.

05:09.440 --> 05:15.050
Focus equals local focus manager Dot current.

05:15.650 --> 05:18.830
And we're going to use this focus to dismiss the keyboard.

05:18.830 --> 05:28.010
OK, so down below in the button in on click, we're going to see focus, dot, clear focus and force.

05:29.030 --> 05:36.530
Equals true, and I'm just going to copy this one and paste that in the on click here as well.

05:37.950 --> 05:38.260
OK.

05:38.400 --> 05:44.280
And of course, we need the focus in that that file as well.

05:44.820 --> 05:45.120
All right.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.520
So let's add the value here.

05:48.900 --> 05:55.860
Focus and then we have our focus in on quick and the same for here.

05:56.340 --> 06:00.390
We have our button now after the button.

06:01.230 --> 06:09.030
We need to add this text value here, so I'm going to copy it or cut it rather and paste it here.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.770
Format, the code.

06:12.280 --> 06:20.740
All right, so we have our go to sign up text field and I'm getting an error.

06:21.310 --> 06:22.180
Why is that?

06:23.920 --> 06:24.370
All right.

06:24.370 --> 06:29.590
So I forgot the closing brackets, OK?

06:30.100 --> 06:32.080
And of course, we need the spinners.

06:32.080 --> 06:39.250
So I'm just going to copy the spinner from here, from the sign up screen and place it in the log in.

06:39.550 --> 06:43.750
However, I'm just going to place it inside the box, but outside the column.

06:44.050 --> 06:47.710
OK, so column is going to be here, but inside the box.

06:48.460 --> 06:51.580
So make sure you place it in the right place.

06:53.880 --> 06:59.220
And I think that is all for the logging UI.

06:59.280 --> 07:09.340
Let's run the code and see if we get the desired screen so we can move between the two screens.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.050
Of course.

07:16.790 --> 07:20.950
All right, so I am in the sign up screen and I can go to logging.

07:21.440 --> 07:26.180
And obviously, I am missing something here.

07:26.750 --> 07:31.490
I forgot the horizontal alignment for the column.

07:31.500 --> 07:39.970
So here after the modifier, I'm going to say horizontal alignment, alignment, dart center horizontally.

07:40.610 --> 07:41.570
Let's run that again.

07:49.410 --> 07:51.810
OK, I'm in the sign up, I go to log in.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.740
OK, let's test the keyboard functionality.

07:55.740 --> 08:00.180
If I click log in, the focus goes away and the same for sign up.

08:00.270 --> 08:04.320
If I click the button, keyboard goes away.

08:04.680 --> 08:12.870
Of course, there is an issue here because we haven't entered any any information in those fields,

08:12.870 --> 08:14.040
so we're going to focus.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.320
We're going to solve that later on.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.800
But for now, I think the log in screen is fine.

08:21.240 --> 08:26.850
The UI is correct and we're going to focus on implementing the functionality, which is going to be

08:26.850 --> 08:34.110
inside the view model on log in function to sign in a user that already exists.

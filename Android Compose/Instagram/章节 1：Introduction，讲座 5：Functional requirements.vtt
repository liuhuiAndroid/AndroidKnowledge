00:00.540 --> 00:06.030
All right, guys, welcome back to a new video, and in this video, we're going to put together the

00:06.270 --> 00:13.110
kind of functional requirements of our application now again, in a real world situation, you would

00:13.110 --> 00:17.340
spend a lot of time on this process and multiple people would be involved.

00:17.610 --> 00:23.700
But in this video, I just want to give you kind of an overview to have a clearer picture of what we're

00:23.700 --> 00:29.820
going to be building in our application and what kind of data we're going to be using and also what

00:29.820 --> 00:36.600
kind of data we're going to be storing in our back API that we will build using Firebase.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.190
OK, so we will see all of that.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.700
So for this purpose, let's go ahead and create a diagram of these screens of our application, and

00:44.700 --> 00:47.580
we're going to extract some requirements from those.

00:47.790 --> 00:53.460
So first of all, the main squeeze that we're going to need are going to be the kind of sign up and

00:53.460 --> 00:54.390
log in screen.

00:54.410 --> 00:56.670
So I'm going to have here sign up screen.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.380
OK.

00:59.370 --> 01:02.610
So that's going to be the screen to create a user.

01:02.940 --> 01:09.090
And the screen for logging if we have an existing user.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.990
And of course, for this, we're going to need Firebase authentication.

01:15.540 --> 01:16.100
OK.

01:16.770 --> 01:20.610
That will require username and password.

01:22.530 --> 01:22.900
All right.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.470
Let's arrange this a little bit nicer.

01:25.500 --> 01:31.260
OK, so we will use Firebase authentication for the sign up process.

01:32.340 --> 01:35.910
OK, here we go.

01:35.970 --> 01:36.360
All right.

01:36.660 --> 01:40.890
So we have our two screens for the authentication.

01:40.930 --> 01:46.170
Now let's move a bit past that because Firebase authentication will be kind of on its own.

01:46.380 --> 01:49.680
And once that is done, we can kind of forget about it.

01:49.710 --> 01:56.070
OK, so the main screen that we're going to have is we're going to have a kind of a feed screen here.

01:57.570 --> 02:03.540
Now, even though this is the first screen that the user sees, I think for us it will be the last screen

02:03.540 --> 02:07.470
that we're going to be building because we need a lot of infrastructure for this screen.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.020
We need to have a user image, a user name we need to have post.

02:13.020 --> 02:14.220
We need to have follows.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.460
So this will kind of be the last thing we're going to be building.

02:18.180 --> 02:24.780
Now, more importantly, we're going to build here a milepost screen.

02:25.140 --> 02:25.560
OK.

02:25.860 --> 02:30.270
Let me put a text here up above because we want to style this a little bit.

02:30.270 --> 02:32.850
So my posts screen.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.110
All right.

02:35.170 --> 02:40.280
So my screen will basically be then you zoom in a little bit.

02:40.300 --> 02:40.620
OK.

02:40.930 --> 02:45.640
Basically, it will be the screen where we can create new posts.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.980
OK, and we have a few elements here.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.050
So first of all, I'm going to add here an image at the top.

02:55.060 --> 02:55.390
OK.

02:55.420 --> 02:59.420
This is going to be a user image and at the top as well.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.610
We will have some information about how many posts we've created, user followers following, etc..

03:06.620 --> 03:09.970
OK, so we will have, for instance, three posts.

03:11.230 --> 03:11.860
OK.

03:12.130 --> 03:17.320
And we will have, let's say, two hundred followers.

03:19.210 --> 03:24.370
OK, whatever information we need to display here, it will be at the top of the screen.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.520
Then down below we will have some user information.

03:27.550 --> 03:32.470
OK, so here we will have, let's say, username.

03:32.890 --> 03:34.480
And we will have bio.

03:34.960 --> 03:43.420
OK, the data for that user that we will fill out in the next screen that site, then we will have kind

03:43.420 --> 03:44.620
of a button here

03:47.320 --> 03:50.620
and this button will take us to edit profile.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.640
OK, let me see if I can just a little bit bigger.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.050
OK.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.450
And then right below it, we will have some posts.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.430
OK, so I have a post here.

04:06.430 --> 04:07.920
I have a post here.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.050
I have another post here.

04:14.870 --> 04:15.350
OK.

04:16.280 --> 04:19.940
You know, you can arrange this as well as you like.

04:22.780 --> 04:27.820
All right, so I have my posts here that I can display the ones that I've already created.

04:28.090 --> 04:36.880
OK, now from my post screen, if I click on user profile, I can then go to an edit profile screen.

04:38.470 --> 04:42.370
OK, now this is going to be edit profile screen.

04:46.470 --> 04:47.010
All right.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.440
In my edit profile screen, I can do a few modifications, right?

04:52.440 --> 05:04.470
So first of all, I can have a user image, OK, I can upload a user image, then I will have some added

05:04.470 --> 05:09.870
functionality for my let's say name here.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.820
Then I will have my username.

05:15.900 --> 05:27.630
And I will also have my bio OK, and we have places to edit this information.

05:28.050 --> 05:31.710
OK, so my name is going to be here.

05:32.430 --> 05:38.100
Then I have my username and I have my bio.

05:38.430 --> 05:42.450
And finally, at the end, I will have the logout

05:44.880 --> 05:45.810
functionality.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.010
All right.

05:47.010 --> 05:53.250
So once we have this, we can kind of extract the information that we need for our user.

05:53.280 --> 06:02.020
OK, so let's put that here and we're going to say user data and what do we need here?

06:02.040 --> 06:04.920
So first of all, we're going to use a we have a user ID.

06:05.130 --> 06:09.750
This will be quite useful in a number of situations to uniquely identify the user.

06:10.230 --> 06:13.260
Next up, we have name, username and bio.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.230
OK, so name, username and bio.

06:16.620 --> 06:21.020
I'm not going to specify the types of data here because this is kind of generic in Scotland.

06:21.030 --> 06:26.130
Obviously, these are going to be strings, so that's we're going to leave that for later.

06:26.370 --> 06:28.200
We're also going to have an image.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.640
You are right.

06:30.630 --> 06:38.820
OK, so the basically the image that we have here and we're also going to have followers, OK, the

06:38.820 --> 06:45.870
followers are going to be basically a list of other user IDs that follow my current user.

06:47.040 --> 06:47.400
All right.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.410
So we have that now.

06:50.070 --> 06:54.260
Let's go ahead and create a new screen here.

06:54.270 --> 07:03.210
So we have, for example, we have our search screen, OK for the third screen.

07:07.160 --> 07:07.400
All right.

07:07.430 --> 07:12.830
For the search screen, it's going to be quite simple, really, it's just going to have a kind of a

07:12.830 --> 07:14.840
search bar here at the top.

07:19.070 --> 07:22.840
OK, and then we're going to have a list of posts.

07:23.150 --> 07:30.190
OK, the posts here that we're going to search for are basically going to send us to a new screen.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.980
OK, and that will be the post screen.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.710
Let me just move this a little bit here.

07:41.210 --> 07:41.480
All right.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.900
So this is the post screen and the post screen.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.700
We can design it a little bit.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.930
So I'm going to have kind of a user image here at the top.

07:52.310 --> 07:54.770
Let me see if I can zoom in a little bit.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.790
The Zoom is not quite there yet for this drawing up file, but it works.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.330
All right, so I have my user image at the top.

08:06.140 --> 08:13.640
Then I will have here the option to follow or unfollow this user.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.000
OK?

08:17.180 --> 08:22.670
We will have basically a text button that says either follow or unfollow, depending on whether or not

08:22.670 --> 08:24.710
we've already followed this user.

08:25.220 --> 08:35.000
Next up, I will have and post image here and then down below we will have, let's say, three likes,

08:36.080 --> 08:42.080
and we will also have, let's say, five comments.

08:45.560 --> 08:55.390
OK, so once we have this kind of structure, let's go ahead and tease out the data type for the post.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.250
OK, that's pretty much all the information we need, I think.

08:58.730 --> 09:09.050
So post data now here again, we will have a Post I.D. We will have a user ID.

09:09.320 --> 09:16.340
OK, so we want to have the information for the user that has created this post and also going to store

09:16.340 --> 09:18.750
a user name just for simplicity.

09:18.770 --> 09:21.380
OK, we want to display the post here.

09:21.380 --> 09:25.520
We want to have the user name, so we will need that as well.

09:26.030 --> 09:28.040
Now I'm going to have a post image,

09:30.870 --> 09:31.520
OK?

09:32.060 --> 09:36.710
I'm also going to have let's see and have I have a host image?

09:37.550 --> 09:41.720
I want to have a post description, which I haven't put here.

09:41.720 --> 09:49.070
I forgot to put down below, but we can have the description here.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.140
OK.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.720
Host description.

09:58.030 --> 10:04.210
OK, now we will also need a few things, so we're going to need a time.

10:06.520 --> 10:06.940
OK?

10:07.600 --> 10:12.130
We need to have this timestamp so that we can order our post in our feed.

10:13.030 --> 10:20.830
And we're also going to need search terms so we can identify some search terms that will bring up this

10:20.830 --> 10:21.730
particular post.

10:21.730 --> 10:27.910
So when we search something here, we if this search term matches one of the search terms of the post,

10:28.120 --> 10:29.170
we can display it.

10:30.070 --> 10:34.550
And then finally, we're going to count the likes for this post.

10:34.570 --> 10:39.010
OK, we're going to have a list of user IDs that have like this post.

10:39.910 --> 10:46.000
Once we're done with that, clicking on the comments will bring us to a new screen here.

10:48.220 --> 10:49.420
And this is going to be.

10:49.990 --> 10:53.110
So let me put some text here.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.000
Comments screen.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.140
And let me put it here as well.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.130
We're going to have post screen.

11:06.240 --> 11:06.600
All right.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.940
So I'm going to have a post screen.

11:08.940 --> 11:13.050
I'm going to have a comment screen in this comment screen.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.970
I'm going to have two things at the bottom.

11:14.970 --> 11:22.200
So first of all, I'm going to have the kind of comment box here that allows me to comment to type my

11:22.200 --> 11:29.730
comment in, and I'm going to have a comment button.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.410
All right, let's see if that works, OK?

11:38.940 --> 11:41.190
All right, so I have my comment button here.

11:41.520 --> 11:47.320
And of course, I have a list of comments in my screen.

11:47.340 --> 11:51.030
OK, so I have, let's say Alex has comment one.

11:53.130 --> 12:00.600
And then let's say here John has comment too.

12:01.050 --> 12:07.500
OK, so this is the list of comments that we will have so we can get the comment information as well.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.020
The comment will be a new data type.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.200
And we're going to have comment data.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.690
And here we're going to have commented.

12:20.580 --> 12:28.800
We're going to have posted so the the post that this comment refers to and we're going to have the username,

12:29.640 --> 12:31.890
we need the text of the comment.

12:33.420 --> 12:39.180
And we're going to have a timestamp so that we can order these comments correctly.

12:40.140 --> 12:40.590
All right.

12:41.020 --> 12:48.270
Now one thing, I'm missing one screen here and that is going to be the post creation screen, which

12:48.270 --> 12:49.110
is quite simple.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.750
Here at the top, I have two options.

12:54.750 --> 12:58.710
I have cancel and I have

13:01.560 --> 13:09.180
post, OK, I'm going to have an image that I can select.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.380
OK.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.220
Something like that.

13:15.550 --> 13:26.920
And I will have here a description that I can type in and that will give me the post creation.

13:27.430 --> 13:27.970
OK.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.800
Let me just arrange this a little bit.

13:31.810 --> 13:32.590
I'm not sure how.

13:32.590 --> 13:34.430
So, first of all, how do we do this?

13:34.430 --> 13:44.320
So from clicking on this image here will take me to the post creation and clicking on the edit profile

13:44.590 --> 13:46.030
will take me here.

13:47.360 --> 13:54.850
OK, now from the post screen, clicking on the comments will take me to the comments screen.

13:57.860 --> 13:58.880
Somewhere here.

13:59.510 --> 14:00.030
OK.

14:00.050 --> 14:05.390
And I think that's it, so let me just put some results here.

14:07.310 --> 14:10.280
This is the post result and clicking on that

14:13.070 --> 14:16.220
will take me to the kind of post screen.

14:18.710 --> 14:19.040
All right.

14:19.430 --> 14:20.030
Something like that.

14:20.270 --> 14:23.630
So it will take me from here to here to here, right?

14:24.650 --> 14:26.660
What else do I need to sit here?

14:26.660 --> 14:34.730
So Firebase, we have authentication and we have two more things that we require in Firebase.

14:34.730 --> 14:40.280
So I'm going to have here Firebase Firestorm.

14:41.780 --> 14:48.080
So the fire store is going to be our kind of database, so the user is going to be stored there.

14:48.380 --> 14:58.690
The host data is going to be stored in Firebase and the comment data is also going to be in fire store

14:58.700 --> 14:59.270
as well.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.360
Let me see if I can put this somewhere better.

15:02.550 --> 15:03.110
I cannot.

15:03.170 --> 15:03.500
All right.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.000
I'm just going to leave it here.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.760
And let me just put it lower down below.

15:16.480 --> 15:16.810
All right.

15:17.050 --> 15:17.950
That's looking good.

15:17.980 --> 15:29.230
So I have my Firebase fire store and I want to have also Firebase storage, and this storage is basically

15:29.230 --> 15:32.000
going to be for the images.

15:32.020 --> 15:41.380
OK, so I'm going to store my image, my user image in fires based storage, and I'm going to store

15:41.380 --> 15:44.110
my post as well.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.950
OK, so kind of this structure.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.520
This is the structure that we're going to be building for our application.

15:51.550 --> 15:56.860
You can see that we have quite a few different screens, but nothing really too crazy.

15:56.860 --> 16:02.410
Of course, you with time in a real world project, you would kind of iterate and improve over this

16:02.410 --> 16:02.950
design.

16:03.220 --> 16:09.460
But for now, for the purposes of this course, I think this will be quite an interesting project to

16:09.460 --> 16:09.790
build.

16:09.790 --> 16:16.510
OK, we've got we have quite a bit of data, quite a bit of, you know, we are going to use Firebase

16:16.510 --> 16:17.020
quite a bit.

16:17.740 --> 16:24.040
One thing I forgot to mention, I think previously is that we're going to be using hilt quite a lot

16:25.900 --> 16:33.070
for dependency injection, and we're also going to be building our application and the end in the Nvidia

16:33.160 --> 16:33.930
architecture.

16:33.940 --> 16:38.980
OK, so these two are going to be quite central to our design as well.

16:39.730 --> 16:40.060
All right.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.950
So I think that's it.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.750
I hope I haven't forgotten anything.

16:43.750 --> 16:47.830
In any case, this is kind of a first draft.

16:47.830 --> 16:53.090
So of course, in code, we can change some things if we need to.

16:53.110 --> 16:56.800
For now, I think though, it's going to be quite sufficient.

16:57.130 --> 16:57.460
All right.

16:57.460 --> 17:01.690
So that's it for kind of the design phase of our application.

17:01.930 --> 17:07.030
In the next video, we will start to actually create the project and start coding.

17:07.120 --> 17:07.430
All right.

17:07.450 --> 17:08.470
And I will see you there.

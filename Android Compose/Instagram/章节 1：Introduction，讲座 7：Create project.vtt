00:00.930 --> 00:07.140
All right, everyone, welcome to the first video where we actually start to create our project and

00:08.370 --> 00:09.390
start coding.

00:09.420 --> 00:16.330
Now before we get started, I want to say a few things about the code and about the bugs in general.

00:16.350 --> 00:23.760
Now I've built this project before I started recording this course, and I spent quite a lot of time

00:23.760 --> 00:26.820
tinkering around and playing around with the code.

00:26.820 --> 00:31.890
So I'm hoping that there's not too many bugs in the code in the final project.

00:32.190 --> 00:36.510
Now, of course, this is software development and no code is 100 percent perfect.

00:36.780 --> 00:40.530
It is possible that some bugs have managed to sneak in.

00:40.770 --> 00:48.480
So I do kindly ask you to be understanding if you do find some issues, some bugs, if you do find them

00:48.690 --> 00:50.400
and you find a solution.

00:50.670 --> 00:52.890
Please post it in the comments.

00:52.890 --> 00:59.460
I will try to update my code and it will be useful for other students to see that there is a solution

00:59.460 --> 01:01.350
to the problem that they might find.

01:01.830 --> 01:02.160
All right.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.190
With that said, let's go ahead and start to create our project.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.080
So I'm here in Android Studio now.

01:08.100 --> 01:16.020
Make sure you have an up to date version that includes compose because we will use Compose for our project

01:16.020 --> 01:16.660
creation.

01:16.690 --> 01:22.380
OK, so go ahead and create a new project, select compose activity and click next.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.910
Give your code some your project, some name.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.770
It doesn't really matter what the name is.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.880
I'm going to say Instagram Clone.

01:30.690 --> 01:35.580
OK, Clone is kind of a pretentious word because it's not really a clone.

01:35.580 --> 01:41.490
It doesn't have nearly as many features, but just going to keep it simple and call it an Instagram

01:41.490 --> 01:46.710
clone, even though we're implementing just a fraction of the features that Instagram has.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.330
Now I'm going to click Finish.

01:56.260 --> 02:00.460
And so we have our project that we can start working on now.

02:00.610 --> 02:07.570
First of all, what I would like to do is I would like to increase the font size to make it easier for

02:07.570 --> 02:11.050
you to see, hopefully font size.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.000
And we're going to do that here.

02:16.030 --> 02:18.190
16 apply.

02:18.370 --> 02:24.550
OK, so hopefully that will look better and it's easy for you to kind of follow along.

02:24.910 --> 02:31.270
So in this first video, we're just going to add the libraries that we're going to need for our project

02:31.570 --> 02:38.530
in the previous lecture, you have a you have some code that you can copy and paste or you can simply

02:38.530 --> 02:40.090
type it out if you choose to.

02:40.300 --> 02:46.210
I'm going to have here, I'm going to open up with double shift, which is search everywhere and I'm

02:46.210 --> 02:48.400
going to open build dot Gradle.

02:49.030 --> 02:53.620
The project file, so not the app file the general project file at first.

02:54.190 --> 03:01.970
And here I'm just going to paste the paste the code for Google Services and Health.

03:01.990 --> 03:04.240
Remember, we're going to be using helped as well.

03:04.570 --> 03:13.570
Now let's open the other build dot Gradle file the app level file and down below where we have our dependencies,

03:13.570 --> 03:15.610
we're going to add a few dependencies here.

03:15.790 --> 03:22.630
OK, so let's just copy and paste the libraries that we're going to need, and we're going to go through

03:22.630 --> 03:25.960
them in a second to kind of point out what they are.

03:26.830 --> 03:31.260
But before that, right at the top, we will need some plugins as well.

03:31.270 --> 03:34.480
So copy and paste those in as well.

03:34.720 --> 03:41.350
We have Google Services, CPT and our Diger Health plugin.

03:41.710 --> 03:43.150
Let's go ahead and sync now.

03:43.420 --> 03:47.230
And it should take some time to kind of download all the libraries.

03:47.230 --> 03:53.650
Hopefully for me, they are already downloaded and the this goes smoothly.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.950
No issues if you have any problems and you're not able to sync.

03:57.190 --> 04:00.910
Make sure you haven't made any mistakes typing here.

04:01.150 --> 04:01.510
OK.

04:02.350 --> 04:02.710
All right.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.300
So let's go through them.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.890
They're not too many, actually.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.410
So let's see what our libraries are.

04:08.710 --> 04:12.280
So obviously we will need the navigation component.

04:12.290 --> 04:15.520
We will use navigation to kind of move through our app.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.650
We're going to use Firebase.

04:17.650 --> 04:20.590
So as we've seen, these are the basics.

04:20.890 --> 04:25.330
We have authentication, firestorm and fire based storage.

04:25.720 --> 04:31.120
Obviously, we need those we will have built for dependency injection.

04:31.690 --> 04:32.050
All right.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.770
We're going to need hilt navigation.

04:34.780 --> 04:40.810
OK, there's the library that specifically designed to work with our navigation, and we're going to

04:40.810 --> 04:42.730
have the compiler as well.

04:42.730 --> 04:45.730
Capability Kotlin compiler.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.240
We're going to use coils for image loading.

04:49.450 --> 04:49.870
OK.

04:49.900 --> 04:57.160
Even though I found some small issues in coil that I would like change, hopefully at some point these

04:57.160 --> 04:58.690
will be implemented.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.430
And this will work fine.

05:00.430 --> 05:05.290
But it is looking like Hoyle is the recommended library by Android.

05:05.290 --> 05:09.820
So we will use that and then we will have code routines as well.

05:09.850 --> 05:16.300
We will use code routines in one specific point in our application, so they are very, very useful.

05:16.690 --> 05:17.020
All right.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.430
So these are the libraries.

05:18.430 --> 05:28.060
Hopefully your code has syncs nicely and there's no problems there and here what we have Google services

05:28.060 --> 05:28.960
and help, right?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.820
So we have everything we need.

05:31.210 --> 05:34.780
Now, keep in mind, navigation is still in beta.

05:35.140 --> 05:40.360
OK, so we do have to be careful about that when you are taking this course.

05:40.630 --> 05:45.280
These libraries might evolve, so you have might have later versions.

05:45.280 --> 05:50.950
So if you do find some bugs, some issues, then go ahead and update to the latest version.

05:51.220 --> 05:56.530
But I'm going to use these versions that you find here, and I do recommend that you keep these versions

05:56.530 --> 06:06.160
here because if there are any changes that kind of break previous versions, then this code might not

06:06.160 --> 06:07.210
work 100 percent.

06:07.210 --> 06:14.740
So it's better to keep everyone on the same version while we build a project and then later on update

06:14.740 --> 06:18.130
if you need to, if you want to take this application further.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.160
All right, so that's it for this video.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.640
Hopefully, everything works fine up to this point.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.300
In the next few minutes, we're going to start to actually implement our code.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.650
So I will see you there.

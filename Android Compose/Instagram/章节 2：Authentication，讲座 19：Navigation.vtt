00:00.550 --> 00:05.680
All right, so in this video, we're going to create a login screen and we're going to also implement

00:05.680 --> 00:09.670
the navigation between the logging screen and the sign up screen.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.290
OK, so we can move back and forth.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.190
All right.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.040
So let's get started.

00:13.060 --> 00:16.540
We're going to go ahead and create a new codling file.

00:16.870 --> 00:19.270
I'm going to call this login screen.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.730
Make sure that's a file so that it doesn't create the class for us, and then we're going to create

00:24.730 --> 00:29.770
a composable full log in screen.

00:30.790 --> 00:35.650
Now we're going to need a couple of parameters, just like we did for the signup screen.

00:36.100 --> 00:40.930
So we're going to need the nav controller to navigate and we're going to need the view model as well.

00:41.770 --> 00:46.930
OK, we're not going to use them in this video, but of course, we need those to implement the login

00:46.930 --> 00:47.770
screen later on.

00:48.550 --> 00:55.310
Now here, and I'm going to create a text view just to be able to move between this screen and the other.

00:55.330 --> 01:00.970
And I'm just going to copy the text view from here, OK, from the sign up screen.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.220
Already, a user go to log in.

01:03.550 --> 01:09.760
It's going to be the same text view, but with a different message and a different clickable.

01:09.790 --> 01:14.770
OK, so here, instead of this message, I'm going to say something like new here.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.570
Go to sign up and an arrow.

01:20.410 --> 01:20.790
All right.

01:20.800 --> 01:27.920
So we have our login screen now we need to add it to our navigation in our main activity.

01:27.940 --> 01:34.130
OK, so at the top here we have destination screen, so we need another object log in.

01:35.170 --> 01:39.730
That is a destination screen with the root log.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.480
OK, and we need to add it to our nav host.

01:43.780 --> 01:49.930
So composable destination screen dot logging dot root.

01:51.700 --> 01:57.070
And then log in screen with the nav controller.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.350
And the VM.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.830
OK, so we can now navigate between the two.

02:05.860 --> 02:11.640
So let's go ahead and implement a navigation function that we can call throughout our application,

02:11.650 --> 02:16.840
OK, we're going to need to move through different screens from many places in our app.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.820
So that means we're going to add it to our main common bits file.

02:22.390 --> 02:27.100
So here I'm going to say not a composable, but just a simple function.

02:27.670 --> 02:29.290
Navigate to.

02:31.380 --> 02:38.940
NAF controller, and we need a destination which is a destination screen.

02:42.300 --> 02:47.370
All right, so let's go ahead and implement this, we're just going to call the NAF controller dot,

02:47.370 --> 02:57.300
navigate to our destination dark roots with a couple of parameters and that those are going to be pop

02:57.300 --> 02:57.870
up to.

03:00.300 --> 03:08.460
Destination dog roots and launch single top equals true.

03:08.940 --> 03:15.540
Now the reason for these parameters is that, first of all, we may have a user that kind of jumps back

03:15.540 --> 03:19.600
and forth multiple screens, and we don't want to open the same screen multiple times.

03:19.670 --> 03:25.920
OK, so we just need to pop up the back stack to that particular screen and launch it a single time.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.850
That means we pop up to that screen, but we don't launch a new screen.

03:30.090 --> 03:32.340
We just use the existing one.

03:32.550 --> 03:32.860
OK.

03:32.880 --> 03:40.530
That will basically maintain our state and make sure that we don't have a large number of screens in

03:40.530 --> 03:41.490
our back stack.

03:42.330 --> 03:50.470
OK, so we have our navigate to function so we can actually implement that in the log in screen inside

03:50.470 --> 03:51.720
the clickable here.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.150
We're going to say navigate to.

03:56.220 --> 04:04.110
And we're going to pass the NAF controller, and we're going to pass a destination's green dot sign

04:04.110 --> 04:04.320
up.

04:05.500 --> 04:10.870
OK, so we need to navigate to sign up, and we're going to do the same thing in the sign up screen

04:11.800 --> 04:12.310
here.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.590
We're going to see navigate to.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.480
We're going to pass the move controller and destination screen.

04:21.550 --> 04:21.970
Dot.

04:22.060 --> 04:22.660
Log in.

04:23.470 --> 04:28.870
OK, so we're just going to allow the user to move back and forth between log in and sign up.

04:29.350 --> 04:30.390
So that's pretty much it.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.750
Let's go ahead and try out the application and see if we can move between the screens.

04:48.540 --> 04:55.820
All right, so we are in sign up if I click here, I go to log in screen, which is tell me you can

04:55.820 --> 05:00.200
go to sign up so that I can move back and forth between the two.

05:01.040 --> 05:01.370
All right.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.650
So that is navigation implemented.

05:03.650 --> 05:07.460
And I think in the next video, we'll start to implement our login screen.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.210
I will see you there.

Hello, everyone, welcome to this new video on our Instagram clone creation course.

00:07.540 --> 00:14.230
Now in this video, I want to go through a process of requirements elicitation that you would normally

00:14.230 --> 00:16.510
go through when you are creating a project.

00:16.780 --> 00:22.030
Now keep in mind that our project in this course will be quite limited in scope.

00:22.030 --> 00:26.950
So obviously we cannot implement every functionality that Instagram has.

00:26.950 --> 00:33.370
They have a whole team of developers working for years to develop this application, so we will need

00:33.370 --> 00:42.190
to limit our scope to several screens and several pieces of functionality that we can implement in this

00:42.190 --> 00:43.060
particular course.

00:43.090 --> 00:43.330
Right.

00:43.330 --> 00:50.770
So in this video, I want to go through these requirements that we're going to go through and we're

00:50.770 --> 00:53.650
going to see exactly what we're going to implement.

00:54.250 --> 01:01.690
So first of all, we want to have some functionality for sign up and creating a user and being able

01:01.690 --> 01:02.980
to log in and log out.

01:03.010 --> 01:04.450
OK, so let's put that down.

01:04.720 --> 01:10.750
We want to have sign up, log in and logout functionality.

01:12.040 --> 01:19.120
OK, so that will imply we have several screens that we can move between signing sign up and log out.

01:19.660 --> 01:27.370
Now, apart from that, the main kind of screen of our app will be a feed screen where we will see some

01:27.370 --> 01:29.830
posts that other users have created.

01:29.870 --> 01:39.820
OK, so we will need to have a feed screen that will display posts from followed users.

01:41.440 --> 01:48.460
Now, if we don't have any followed users, so if we just created a new user and I just signing in now

01:48.610 --> 02:00.550
for the first time, we will have a general posts list if we haven't followed anyone.

02:01.930 --> 02:07.810
So what we're looking for here is when the user signs up to our application first time, they will still

02:07.810 --> 02:10.180
see something in the feed.

02:10.180 --> 02:14.020
They won't have an empty feed that looks quite quite ugly and quite empty.

02:14.800 --> 02:20.980
Now we also want a screen where we can search for existing posts based on a keyword.

02:20.990 --> 02:27.820
OK, so we will have a search screen where I can search for a keyword.

02:29.480 --> 02:37.480
OK, so this basically will give me posts that have this keyword so that I can look at the posts, follow

02:37.480 --> 02:38.890
the users and so on.

02:39.610 --> 02:44.590
Then we will also need a screen where we basically create new posts.

02:44.590 --> 02:55.420
So a my screen where I can create new posts, and this screen will also display the posts that I've

02:55.420 --> 03:03.340
already created and see posts that I have already created.

03:05.170 --> 03:07.000
OK, so I have the screen now.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.770
What else do we need?

03:07.780 --> 03:13.750
We will need a profile screen where we can edit our personal information.

03:13.750 --> 03:26.140
So Profile Edit screen where I can edit my info info and upload a photo.

03:26.260 --> 03:30.700
OK, so we want the possibility to upload a personal photo for our profile.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.860
We will do that in the profile screen.

03:33.760 --> 03:40.060
And then finally, we have a screen where we can see a single post.

03:40.240 --> 03:48.490
OK, so we have a screen where I can see details of a post.

03:50.410 --> 03:55.990
And here we will include, including likes and comments.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.550
OK, so those are kind of the screens that our application will have.

04:02.560 --> 04:09.910
It will be centered around posts, OK, and we will be able to see these posts in different kinds of

04:09.910 --> 04:12.610
situations and follow them accordingly.

04:12.940 --> 04:15.280
Now I want to have some abilities here.

04:17.260 --> 04:18.760
OK, let's put them down.

04:19.270 --> 04:21.790
I have the ability to create a post.

04:23.920 --> 04:28.600
I want to have the ability to like a post from a certain user.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.600
I want to be able to comment on a post.

04:33.580 --> 04:40.060
And I want the ability to follow and unfollow a user.

04:41.470 --> 04:47.110
OK, so I want this ability, these abilities to be kind of integral to the app.

04:47.110 --> 04:54.320
So our app will basically be centered around posts around our feeds and around our search functionality.

04:54.340 --> 04:54.560
OK.

04:54.580 --> 04:58.260
And kind of the other screens are supportive of that.

04:58.270 --> 05:03.850
We want to be able to have kind of the infrastructure that allows us to see these posts in different

05:03.850 --> 05:04.570
situations.

05:04.570 --> 05:09.670
And of course, if you want later on, you can expand the application to add more functionality, such

05:09.670 --> 05:17.170
as stories and other functionalities that you know, Instagram has implemented, but we already have

05:17.170 --> 05:19.390
quite a bit of work to implement.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.710
So I think we will limit ourselves to this, this kind of functionality.

05:23.950 --> 05:27.250
And of course, we have a lot to implement here.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.930
Now this is all for the kind of high level requirements elicitation.

05:32.170 --> 05:39.880
And in the next video, I want to kind of detail a little bit these individual screens and see how what

05:39.880 --> 05:46.540
kind of data we need to back this up and what kind of backend services we will require to make this

05:46.720 --> 05:48.370
kind of functionality possible.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.100
OK, so that's it for this video, and I'll see you in the next one.

WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:03.630
So now let's go ahead and put together this profile image.

00:03.650 --> 00:06.020
First, we'll have to add that image.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.040
So what do we need to do?

00:07.130 --> 00:10.070
Let's go to our friends folder there instead of troubles.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.200
And you should have access to this image.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.100
We can find any image on the internet.

00:14.150 --> 00:14.930
That's fine.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.100
What do we need to do?

00:16.100 --> 00:19.730
Is once you get that image, you need to drag that image onto drabble.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.670
So have the image here.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.940
We just copy that and paste inside there.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.070
You can drag or you can just paste it all in.

00:28.430 --> 00:28.940
And there we go.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.700
You can see there is the profile image that JPEG.

00:31.910 --> 00:36.230
Make sure if you're getting an image file is exactly this naming convention here.

00:36.230 --> 00:41.510
So lowercase and underscore if you have more than one word, it's very important for Android.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.560
OK, there we go.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.470
We have that image there, so we are going to create this entity, so we are now going to create this.

00:49.010 --> 00:57.260
Now the concept behind Compose is that we are using smaller, composable functions to create a bigger

00:57.290 --> 00:58.250
user interface.

00:58.580 --> 01:02.720
Declaratively, again, we're going to go through all of that at a later time who just going through

01:02.720 --> 01:05.510
this process, the motions of this just to get started, really.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.850
So you get excited about this course, OK?

01:08.240 --> 01:14.150
So the idea again, is to create the smaller pieces that we can view them and then put them on top of

01:14.150 --> 01:17.930
other pieces so we can create the fuller user interface.

01:18.260 --> 01:24.440
With that, we are going to think about a different way to create these design phases and then add them

01:24.440 --> 01:29.450
on top of each other so we could obviously go up here or inside of our card because it's going to be

01:29.450 --> 01:34.400
inside of this card here and start pulling together the code to create our profile.

01:34.820 --> 01:39.410
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another surface here because again, surface can be anything

01:39.500 --> 01:40.790
that could make just the background.

01:40.790 --> 01:43.070
We can bend it, we can do whatever we want with it.

01:43.490 --> 01:43.790
All right.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.320
So we have a surface here.

01:45.380 --> 01:49.870
You can get rid of all of that, of course, and it's not needed in makes inside of a surface.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.860
We want to bend it, we want to customize it.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.290
So it looks exactly like this.

01:54.710 --> 01:58.940
And at this point here, you should think about, OK, what would be the parameter we're going to be

01:58.940 --> 02:05.990
passing inside here so that we can bend or customize our surface so that it looks circular and we can

02:05.990 --> 02:06.770
add an image to it?

02:07.130 --> 02:13.910
Well, Modifier Modifier is our friend, so I'm going to say modifier am going to pass the same modifier

02:14.030 --> 02:20.330
as such and I'm going to go and first of all, create a size or not create invoke this size and set

02:20.330 --> 02:22.010
it up the size here again.

02:22.040 --> 02:28.190
It allows us to pass either width and height or just the size in general to say that whatever we pass

02:28.190 --> 02:30.560
here, it's going to apply for width and height.

02:31.010 --> 02:36.110
So I'm going to say for width and height, and you can just pass it like that deep, of course.

02:36.860 --> 02:37.130
OK.

02:37.520 --> 02:37.850
All right.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.090
And the next thing I want to do, I'm going to put a new line, say Dot again.

02:41.090 --> 02:46.670
And still, instead of a modifier game, let's say padding one padding around all is going to be about

02:46.670 --> 02:49.100
five dpi like this?

02:49.430 --> 02:49.850
Very good.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.200
And the next parameter, I'm going to pass inside of a surface.

02:53.220 --> 02:54.890
Make sure we're inside of our surface.

02:54.890 --> 02:56.360
Here is the border.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.070
If you have her over, in fact, to know what parameters we can pass, you can just hover over and we'll

03:01.070 --> 03:04.460
give you exactly all the parameters you can pass right past.

03:04.460 --> 03:10.250
Modifier can also pass that layers fine shape, color, border content, elevation, so forth.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.310
In fact, let's just follow the order here, right?

03:13.320 --> 03:14.660
Let's go to shape first.

03:14.960 --> 03:20.390
So I'm going to say shape, and I'm going to say I want to circle shape like that.

03:20.540 --> 03:25.100
If you just want to have a circle shape you don't have, you don't want to do anything to it.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.830
You can just call it circle shape of this.

03:27.950 --> 03:33.320
If you have over, you going to see that this is just a circle shape with all the corner sized as the

03:33.320 --> 03:35.180
50 percent of the shape size.

03:35.630 --> 03:38.870
So it's all going to be round, which is exactly what we want.

03:39.470 --> 03:39.770
All right.

03:40.250 --> 03:44.270
And the next thing we're going to do is let's go ahead and pass the color.

03:44.570 --> 03:47.060
Actually, let's go ahead and pass the border thing tomorrow of great.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.710
And the moment you start typing, you can see the border property requires a border stroke.

03:51.710 --> 03:58.100
So Mercedes equal hit enter and we're invoke the border stroke and you can see the border stroke here

03:58.100 --> 04:02.960
requires width and color or width and brush, but we'll get into that more.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.240
So what is the width of this border?

04:05.450 --> 04:11.600
Well, I'm going to say it's going to be zero point five dpi, so not even one very, very small.

04:11.960 --> 04:17.840
And for the color, I'm going to use the color that we can get from Android Compose UI like this or

04:17.850 --> 04:19.850
colors that come with compose.

04:20.240 --> 04:26.270
And I'm going to say, I want this to be light gray again, and I'm going to get out of that and continue.

04:26.270 --> 04:32.000
I want to say elevation of about four dpi to be a little bit higher than the background.

04:32.090 --> 04:35.420
So it has that very nice material theme look.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.070
All right.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.290
Let's see if if this looks anything like we want.

04:39.830 --> 04:40.610
And there you have.

04:40.610 --> 04:45.560
It doesn't look quite like what we want, but at least we can see there is a skeleton here.

04:45.950 --> 04:50.330
OK, so it's very round, but it's more like a pill than what we want.

04:50.450 --> 04:50.870
It's OK.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.610
We're going to get there, but at least we can see something.

04:52.610 --> 04:53.660
It's working, right?

04:53.810 --> 04:57.860
The next thing after elevation, what we can do can also pass the color.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.040
I won't say color.

04:59.300 --> 04:59.610
Now for.

05:00.010 --> 05:06.520
As you saw earlier, I can go ahead and just invoke color object, if you will, and then get white,

05:06.520 --> 05:11.920
light gray, whatever color, but I can also say something like this in the same material theme.

05:12.220 --> 05:16.630
So this is part of, Of course, material theme that comes with compose.

05:16.930 --> 05:23.760
So if I just go into material theme, I can say, Dad, I can go to colors and you can see on surface,

05:24.220 --> 05:25.450
OK, like this.

05:25.750 --> 05:31.210
And then I can do other things I can say, for instance, copy to say that I'm going to modify this

05:31.210 --> 05:36.760
a little bit in this case, the alpha meaning how visible this color is going to be.

05:36.940 --> 05:40.660
And where has that zero point five f like this?

05:40.870 --> 05:47.230
OK, so not to go into a lot of details here because again, we will take the time to go into all the

05:47.230 --> 05:48.190
details later, OK?

05:48.580 --> 05:54.910
But what we're doing here is just actually evoking the material theme that comes with our project already.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.680
We're going to go and say colors.

05:56.950 --> 06:01.900
And in fact, if you open our project, you will go to white theme.

06:02.580 --> 06:02.950
There we go.

06:02.950 --> 06:05.280
We have color, shape, theme and so forth.

06:05.290 --> 06:05.800
Like Double.

06:06.220 --> 06:09.670
There's all of these colors are be invoked here and we'll get to that.

06:10.210 --> 06:15.790
But what we're saying here, we want to take the material theme of the project, get the colors on the

06:15.790 --> 06:21.130
surface here if you have over it, says color used to text and icons displayed on top of this surface

06:21.130 --> 06:21.550
color.

06:22.600 --> 06:29.110
And then we are just saying, OK, we want to actually make the alpha property of this little bit dimmer.

06:29.110 --> 06:30.670
Not too bright, if you will.

06:31.510 --> 06:32.530
The visibility of that.

06:33.040 --> 06:33.270
All right.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.660
So now do we have this code?

06:34.660 --> 06:35.770
We have a surface.

06:36.130 --> 06:40.760
What we want to do really is to have that image we added inside of this, right?

06:40.780 --> 06:43.360
So it looks again something like this.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.670
Well, how do we do that to do that?

06:45.730 --> 06:46.270
Of course.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.320
Remember inside of our surface, here we pass all these parameters, right?

06:50.530 --> 06:55.960
But then we have this block, which means now we can add something inside of the surface.

06:56.320 --> 06:56.620
All right.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.240
So what is it we want to add?

06:58.540 --> 07:02.230
Well, first I'm going to say image because that's what what going to add image.

07:02.230 --> 07:05.890
There's different overloaded image functions here, right?

07:06.250 --> 07:09.580
We're going to use the first one, which is we need to pass a painter.

07:09.610 --> 07:15.550
So painter is going to be the object that will go and get what is it exactly that we want to paint onto

07:15.550 --> 07:16.060
the screen?

07:16.090 --> 07:18.070
Meaning what image we want to show?

07:18.490 --> 07:25.180
So I'm going to say Painter is a painter, a such resource because we want to go through our resource

07:25.630 --> 07:28.000
and get our image so he can enter.

07:28.420 --> 07:35.110
And then I'm going to say in this case, are Dot Draw able to go to our troubles and get the profile

07:35.110 --> 07:35.470
image?

07:35.890 --> 07:40.960
So what we're doing here, we're going to art through our resource class that is hidden somewhere and

07:40.960 --> 07:42.820
we're invoking the tribal folder.

07:43.090 --> 07:49.540
So we go into our tribal folder and get our profile image, JPEG or whatever name you added.

07:49.720 --> 07:55.230
And you can see here in the gutter, there is indeed that image showing very good at everything.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.980
Also you notice here is that we must pass something else right in our image.

08:00.130 --> 08:02.230
We must pass the content description.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.100
What is this?

08:03.310 --> 08:09.970
This will allow for our visually impaired folks to be able to know exactly what this image is supposed

08:09.970 --> 08:10.960
to represent.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.290
Right.

08:11.500 --> 08:17.470
So we're going to say here profile image like this description of the image?

08:18.250 --> 08:20.630
OK, so in after that, we're going to pass a modifier.

08:20.660 --> 08:26.860
Notice the theme here is that modifier allows us to then modify as a name, imply our function, right?

08:26.920 --> 08:32.380
How it's going to relay the information we passing can say modify or die size and then just give it

08:32.390 --> 08:36.400
one big size of 135 dpi as such.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.060
OK.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.050
And there we go.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.690
It doesn't look that great, but we're going to fix that.

08:41.020 --> 08:46.300
So next thing we're going to do for our image here, we are going to pass a content scale because we

08:46.300 --> 08:48.820
want to scale this to a better size other than this.

08:49.270 --> 08:50.320
So and so here.

08:50.320 --> 08:56.600
And when I say content scale and I want to crop it, let's see something is not right.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.250
Obviously, we don't want this to take the whole space.

09:00.550 --> 09:06.220
As you see here, I because the image now is taking this whole entire view, which is, of course,

09:06.220 --> 09:08.560
our surface here inside of our card.

09:09.010 --> 09:14.320
But I also have to remember something that the contents of this whole card will have something like

09:14.320 --> 09:17.380
this because we are not just going to have the image right.

09:17.470 --> 09:20.770
We are also going to have other elements here.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.530
Going to have this divider and name and all this stuff.

09:23.620 --> 09:31.540
So we need to figure out a way to subdivide this whole view so that all of these can be accommodated

09:31.540 --> 09:32.200
accordingly.

09:32.410 --> 09:34.510
And that's what we're going to be doing in the next video.

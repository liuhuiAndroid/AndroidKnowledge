WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:06.990
All right, so now it's time for us to get started and putting together the application, but most importantly,

00:06.990 --> 00:10.830
we're going to add the we're going to start small and adding the things that we need.

00:11.490 --> 00:11.790
All right.

00:11.790 --> 00:14.040
So I went ahead and created a new project.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.170
A dot reader can name whatever we want.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.580
And so we have it's all set up, and now it's time for us to get started.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.560
So what I'm going to do first, of course, is we know that we will need a few things.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.320
But the main thing is that we need Firebase.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.470
So Firebase is a backend that allows us to create databases, but most importantly, allows us to scale

00:34.470 --> 00:36.240
our app quickly and easily.

00:36.420 --> 00:42.360
Now what do we need to do is to go to Firebase, Stockholm or Firebase or Google that comes if you type

00:42.360 --> 00:46.080
in, you should have a Google account in order for this to work.

00:46.230 --> 00:47.040
I'm assuming you do.

00:47.040 --> 00:53.340
If not, you have to create an account and then you should be able to go to a firebase that come Firebase

00:53.340 --> 00:56.940
at Google that is dot com with S. And I'm already logged in.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.610
That's why you have my picture there.

00:59.970 --> 01:02.220
And why do we need to do from here or just go to console?

01:02.640 --> 01:05.280
You'll see that we have here your Firebase project.

01:05.290 --> 01:08.460
See if this is the first time you probably won't have any of these.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.440
Which is fine in this case.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.290
I do have a few projects, so that's why they are there.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.650
So what do we need to do is say add project.

01:16.830 --> 01:23.970
So but in this case here, I'm just going to say, get a reader like this to name our app.

01:25.060 --> 01:33.220
OK, I say continue, and it's going to ask us to, of course, add Google Analytics for the Firebase

01:33.220 --> 01:33.700
Project.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.650
I don't want any of this.

01:35.860 --> 01:41.320
I'm just going to not add any of those sorts of say, create and now is creating the chat.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.670
A reader project Firebase projects so may take a few seconds.

01:46.660 --> 01:48.520
You can see that a reader is done.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.080
Your new project is ready.

01:50.410 --> 01:55.870
Go ahead and click there, and it should be taken to this screen here.

01:55.990 --> 02:01.810
The beauty about having a Firebase project is that you can include different platforms.

02:01.810 --> 02:06.190
You have Apple, iOS, Android have web, we have unity and so forth.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.580
So this is really good because you could have an app that is an iOS app, Android and web, but the

02:12.580 --> 02:14.680
data is still the same right to database.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.040
The back end is the same, so you can leverage the same database.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.360
OK, so what do we need to do here?

02:20.380 --> 02:22.030
Let's go ahead and click Android.

02:22.210 --> 02:27.040
As such, now we need to add a few things here in our registered app here.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.050
So notice it says we need to add the Android package name.

02:31.090 --> 02:35.470
If you click there, it's going to say your package name is generally the application ID in your app

02:35.470 --> 02:37.670
level build.gradle.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.130
Let's go to our project.

02:39.310 --> 02:40.570
Go to app level.

02:40.660 --> 02:46.630
Build that Gradle this one so you can see application and this is mine now for you.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.250
It's going to be something different.

02:48.340 --> 02:48.640
Right?

02:48.850 --> 02:52.680
So go to the second below Gradle.

02:52.690 --> 02:59.350
So the one that says module and that app like that and then go to default or find where application

02:59.350 --> 02:59.840
it is.

02:59.860 --> 03:04.180
So you want to copy that and we're going to add that has to be exactly that.

03:04.420 --> 03:08.090
OK, so go and find yours and the app nickname here.

03:08.110 --> 03:08.980
This is optional.

03:08.990 --> 03:12.650
Essentially, it's going to be the nickname we're going to see in the console.

03:12.760 --> 03:19.890
I'm going to say a reader, git, a reader, android and then the debug signing certificate.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.220
We don't need to worry about that.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.410
We're going to go ahead and just register the app.

03:23.440 --> 03:23.740
All right.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.480
So now we need to download the config file.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.160
He says Google services that JSON and then wants to be download here.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.750
We need to move that into our app module root directory.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.760
OK, let's go ahead and click here to download.

03:37.510 --> 03:42.140
And you can see here it has even an image to show us where we supposed to add.

03:42.160 --> 03:46.360
So it has to be at our root folder in our Android app.

03:46.450 --> 03:49.900
So let's go ahead and open this finder.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.070
Go to our project.

03:51.250 --> 03:51.600
All right.

03:51.610 --> 03:56.320
So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to change the view of our project here.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.370
I'm going to click there.

03:57.370 --> 04:03.880
I want to see the project so I can have access to all the files and so forth so I can see there is the

04:03.880 --> 04:04.210
app.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.420
So I'm going to add it to this root folder here, making sure it's going to be exactly like this.

04:08.420 --> 04:14.950
So you see, we have the source and we have the pro guide rules, so it's going to be at the same level

04:14.950 --> 04:16.840
as provide rules there.

04:17.350 --> 04:25.090
So I have it on my desktop and when it gets added there, I'm going to say refactor and everything.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.140
Sure.

04:26.590 --> 04:27.590
This is for my get.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.190
That's fine.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.290
And voila, there it is.

04:29.590 --> 04:29.860
OK.

04:29.950 --> 04:31.180
Just make sure it is correct.

04:31.630 --> 04:31.980
Yes.

04:32.010 --> 04:32.680
Has to be there.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.170
So this is your Google service.

04:35.170 --> 04:41.110
I decide you should keep it to yourself because this contains all of the information needed for the

04:41.110 --> 04:42.830
app, the authorizations and so forth.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.590
So don't share that with anyone.

04:45.190 --> 04:49.330
OK, so back to our configuration, I'm going to say next.

04:49.690 --> 04:49.990
All right.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.380
So now saying that we need to make some changes in our Gradle?

04:53.470 --> 04:55.090
So what do we need to do here?

04:55.420 --> 05:00.310
First of all, this has to be the project level build that Gradle, which means.

05:01.970 --> 05:06.770
Let's change this back to Android, so we can just see the files that we need.

05:07.310 --> 05:10.220
This is going to be the project level six project there to click.

05:10.820 --> 05:11.960
Let's go ahead and take a look.

05:12.020 --> 05:12.860
It has to be.

05:13.310 --> 05:15.410
Let's check that we have Google.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.880
Is that right?

05:17.300 --> 05:18.040
We have Google.

05:18.050 --> 05:18.710
That's very good.

05:19.670 --> 05:25.760
And now Independency says, we have to add this, so I'm going to just copy this such.

05:27.230 --> 05:32.780
And add at the bottom, there looks like everything is good and you can see sometimes there are some

05:32.780 --> 05:36.180
differences the way things are laid out in our cradle.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.580
But the idea is still the same.

05:37.580 --> 05:38.620
We have repositories.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.030
Make sure that, you know, build script.

05:42.660 --> 05:46.440
Will script repositories has all of that, so we should be good.

05:46.680 --> 05:51.030
We just had to have that Google repository called there while I'm here.

05:51.410 --> 05:56.670
And go ahead and change this to the newer version because it's asking.

05:57.330 --> 06:02.580
And while I'm here, he also, I'm going to change this to four, because that's the latest compose

06:02.580 --> 06:03.000
version.

06:03.010 --> 06:03.270
OK?

06:03.420 --> 06:04.860
All right, let's continue.

06:05.100 --> 06:10.440
And now in our app level bill that Gradle assisted app level, we need to add a few things.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.720
So it says, first of all, apply.

06:13.350 --> 06:14.550
We're going to add this line.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.530
I'm going to copy this.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.140
You can do that.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.890
So this let's go back now.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.060
See here, this is the app build.gradle.

06:22.400 --> 06:28.880
The top here, let's go ahead and add apply plug in in this case now because there have been some changes.

06:28.900 --> 06:35.440
What we need to do, actually, I can remove all of this and you can see just ID like this that works

06:35.440 --> 06:35.860
as well.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.440
OK, and then we're going to add this dependency here.

06:38.440 --> 06:43.330
I'm going to copy and go down to dependencies.

06:43.990 --> 06:49.210
So I would start off somewhere here, let's say Firebase Store.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.480
So I know and pacing there, they're very good.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.380
And now we're going to go ahead and says, here they want to sync our project.

06:56.810 --> 06:57.070
All right.

06:57.070 --> 06:58.240
Let's go ahead and sync.

06:58.810 --> 06:59.120
All right.

06:59.140 --> 07:04.150
After a few moments, you see that the Gradle has updated and everything should be good.

07:04.450 --> 07:09.220
Now they have a couple of dependencies for Firebase authentication and Cloud First Order.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.840
I'm going to add here.

07:10.870 --> 07:15.210
So all of that you can actually go this just say next year.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.850
So you can actually check out the documentation.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.640
You can also explore the sample.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.920
Firebase app was right click and open this link.

07:24.310 --> 07:29.650
We're going to click this Android, and there's this very nice gentleman who walks you through everything,

07:29.650 --> 07:30.550
which is really nice.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.540
But if you scroll down, you'll see exactly what you've done, right?

07:34.810 --> 07:36.700
All the dependencies we had to add.

07:37.210 --> 07:42.580
And then at the bottom, you will see that we have codling Katie X for Android.

07:42.580 --> 07:49.090
So usually there is Java on go to Kotlin and you can see that we've added this dependency to fire boom.

07:49.350 --> 07:50.260
I firebase boom.

07:50.740 --> 07:57.550
And we don't need this dependency because we're not using we're not using Google Analytics, but it

07:57.550 --> 08:01.410
says here declares dependency for any other desired Firebase products.

08:01.460 --> 08:07.150
And so say, for example, they declare the dependencies for Firebase authentication and cloud first,

08:07.150 --> 08:08.350
or which is exactly what we want.

08:08.590 --> 08:10.000
So that's where I got this from.

08:10.030 --> 08:13.900
So just copy all of that as I did and added there.

08:14.170 --> 08:17.560
So I can also add here Firebase

08:23.380 --> 08:24.760
and Fire Store.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.290
OK, so once again, let's go ahead and sync our project here.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.270
OK, it looks like everything went well.

08:31.540 --> 08:37.120
OK, so now how do I know that this is actually working, that I have everything set up with Firebase?

08:37.630 --> 08:44.590
Well, one of things you can do is actually just run this app as it is right now, and let's go to our

08:44.590 --> 08:51.250
Logcat and for debugging, we can look for Firebase a minute.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.760
Change this to a verbose.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.400
Still running looks like I have a few problems here.

09:01.420 --> 09:07.720
That's not a problem because these are versioning issues, so says the version one that 04 for composed

09:07.720 --> 09:10.970
compiler requires Kotlin one five through one.

09:10.990 --> 09:12.740
So this is something we need to do.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.740
Remember, all of these may change depending on when you're watching this video, because these versions

09:17.740 --> 09:18.880
change constantly.

09:18.910 --> 09:25.660
OK, so whatever version they are telling us to change here, we need to add that this is happening

09:25.660 --> 09:30.760
because if we go back to our build that app, I change the actually build that Gradle.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.830
This is the project level.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.240
I change to one zero four.

09:34.690 --> 09:40.870
That means then here for our plug in, I need to change to what they ask, which is one point five thirty

09:40.870 --> 09:41.530
one like this?

09:42.400 --> 09:42.660
OK.

09:44.230 --> 09:46.060
So go ahead and sink once again.

09:46.600 --> 09:46.990
OK.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.240
Looks like the sinking went well.

09:49.510 --> 09:54.010
It looks like device and lock initializing all purpose APIs for app default.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.820
That's good.

09:55.300 --> 10:00.670
Let's go ahead and actually run now and hopefully see something that will tell us that this is actually

10:01.450 --> 10:03.280
initialized and all is good.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.090
All right.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.710
You should see something like this.

10:06.730 --> 10:08.650
If you ran the your app, hello, android.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.800
But most importantly, we should see here and verbose.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.050
It would have been Firebase to search for.

10:14.050 --> 10:17.980
It concedes as Firebase initialization successful.

10:17.980 --> 10:23.170
So we know now that everything is set up for us to start looking at working with Firebase.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.820
All right, congratulations.

10:24.830 --> 10:28.210
Make sure you go through this process so that you have everything set up.

10:28.600 --> 10:33.130
Remember that these versions may be different, but each time you watch this video, so don't get hung

10:33.130 --> 10:35.860
up on these versions of all of these dependencies, OK?

10:36.130 --> 10:41.680
So what's important is that you understand how to set things up and that if you need to change those

10:41.680 --> 10:43.000
versions, you must to change.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.060
You must change those versions and make sure that if you change certain versions of certain dependencies,

10:49.630 --> 10:55.330
you will probably most likely have to change the other dependencies that remained on that dependency

10:55.330 --> 10:56.110
fragmented sense.

10:56.380 --> 11:03.670
So but the beauty is that the build.gradle Gradle here will always tell us exactly which things or which

11:03.670 --> 11:06.040
dependencies need to be need to be updated.

11:06.130 --> 11:06.510
Great.

11:06.520 --> 11:11.110
So we know that the Firebase initialization is successful.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.680
In fact, if you go back to our app here, say Continue.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.700
Can see we have our app.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.540
There we go.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.560
This is the app that we just created.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.360
That's my app.

11:21.540 --> 11:27.120
In this case, you should have a different name and so forth, but it's there so we can now do all sort

11:27.130 --> 11:27.970
of things right.

11:28.020 --> 11:34.260
We can create authentication and faster and images in so many services that we can use now.

11:34.860 --> 11:41.700
One thing I would like to point out is that inside of our Android setup with Firebase here, where we

11:41.700 --> 11:48.540
went and got our Kotlin dependencies for off in first store, if you scroll down, continue, scroll

11:48.540 --> 11:48.840
down.

11:48.840 --> 11:55.920
You will see that we have all the available libraries here, Java, Android, but we want to cut lean

11:56.550 --> 11:57.180
T.X.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.190
Android, right?

11:58.200 --> 12:03.680
So far, based here has a lot of different services this AdMob for ads.

12:03.690 --> 12:09.000
So this this is this would be the service you would add all the dependency you would add.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.310
There's analytics, as you saw before.

12:11.310 --> 12:18.390
We can add that all of these kinds that you can add all of these different services for Firebase cloud

12:18.390 --> 12:22.910
storage, remote and so many, so many, so many others, right?

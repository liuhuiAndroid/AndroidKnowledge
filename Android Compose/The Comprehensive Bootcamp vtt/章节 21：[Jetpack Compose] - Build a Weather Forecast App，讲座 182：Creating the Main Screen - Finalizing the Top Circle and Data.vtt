WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:04.470
So so far, we have dummy data for here to top the date of today.

00:04.870 --> 00:05.100
Right.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.210
And we have damning data also for the weather or the temperature, I should say, as well as the description

00:12.210 --> 00:13.740
of the weather today.

00:14.270 --> 00:15.780
OK, so let's change that.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.420
Let's start with the top data there.

00:19.290 --> 00:25.950
How do we get the date, the data for each one of these days or weather description of the day?

00:26.040 --> 00:26.940
We have this date.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.750
So this is timestamp.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.030
This is Unix timestamp.

00:30.030 --> 00:36.840
So that means we have to convert this into a date, something that we can see, something that perhaps

00:36.840 --> 00:38.820
looks like this Monday, November 29th.

00:39.030 --> 00:41.480
So let's let's let's, first of all, get that information.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.450
Then we're going to deal with it.

00:43.530 --> 00:49.740
Our data, which is our weather and we've been using it to get some information we can do so for our

00:50.010 --> 00:50.820
date here.

00:51.420 --> 00:52.710
So what do we do?

00:53.610 --> 00:54.570
We say data.

00:55.050 --> 00:59.640
I'm going to go to the list, of course, and we know just getting for today at the top here, that's

00:59.910 --> 01:00.750
what we're going to show.

01:01.020 --> 01:07.320
So it's OK to just go in and say zero like that, and then I'm going to go to the temp object and then

01:07.320 --> 01:07.980
get the date.

01:08.640 --> 01:14.820
So again, what I'm doing going to do list to get the first object, which is today, go to the temp

01:15.060 --> 01:19.320
object inside and go get the date, the temperature for today.

01:20.190 --> 01:20.490
All right.

01:20.490 --> 01:25.190
So this isn't metric, as you can see the Eunice's metric, that's why it says 12.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.730
So we're going to change that to Imperial.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.700
So you can see the difference as well.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.970
So it depends depending on where you live in the world.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.580
You can change to imperial or metric.

01:35.810 --> 01:38.760
OK, so 52 degrees for my American friends.

01:39.240 --> 01:39.510
All right.

01:39.510 --> 01:42.630
So 52 degrees, that's for during the day.

01:42.840 --> 01:48.120
So that's what we're going to be using or that's what we're using to show here right now.

01:48.120 --> 01:54.240
This is going to be problematic because I want to make sure that this is a strong suit to stream like

01:54.240 --> 01:54.930
that could.

01:54.930 --> 01:55.830
That's what's needed there.

01:56.640 --> 01:56.910
All right.

01:56.910 --> 01:57.750
So let's go ahead and run.

01:59.180 --> 01:59.730
Well, I'm sorry.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.160
That is right.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.300
This is not the date I want to date.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.890
Not today.

02:05.070 --> 02:05.470
All right.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.200
My bet, it's going to run in a way.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.150
Let's see what's going to show there.

02:10.310 --> 02:10.610
OK.

02:10.640 --> 02:11.290
Thirty six.

02:11.300 --> 02:11.730
88.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.700
That's not what we want, but we'll get there.

02:14.390 --> 02:17.870
So I want instead, I want the date.

02:18.170 --> 02:19.510
So go back.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.030
I'm going to see list zero and just go and see.

02:23.960 --> 02:24.770
That's what I want.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.700
I'm going to say to string so we can see the same in a way.

02:29.030 --> 02:33.200
So I'm getting this, so I'm just going to get the string representation of our date.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.680
OK, there we go.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.210
That's very long.

02:36.230 --> 02:37.910
No, that makes no sense to us.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.830
But at least we know we're getting the information now.

02:40.070 --> 02:45.440
Let's go ahead and format this into something that it's readable, humanly readable, something like

02:45.440 --> 02:45.710
this.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.320
Well, for that, let's go to our utils.

02:48.320 --> 02:56.180
I'm going to create yet another class here or just a file call utils like this, and I'm going to pasting

02:56.180 --> 02:56.910
some code.

02:56.930 --> 03:02.090
Now I'm piecing it all of this because it just makes no sense to me to type it all.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.910
It's something that you will have access to, and it's very simple.

03:04.910 --> 03:05.270
So they do.

03:05.390 --> 03:06.020
What are we doing here?

03:06.050 --> 03:10.670
I'm going to use these other ones later, but many days that we have, for instance, creating this

03:10.670 --> 03:15.610
format data would pass in the timestamp in integer and we return a string.

03:15.620 --> 03:20.090
So I'm using this simple data format and passing the pattern right.

03:20.090 --> 03:22.700
Depending on different patterns, we want to show off our date.

03:22.820 --> 03:23.860
So that's all I'm doing here.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.790
Of course, I use the Java you till date.

03:25.790 --> 03:33.020
I convert everything and blah blah blah, and then I use the format method to format it into these patterns.

03:33.020 --> 03:34.240
So we show the actual date.

03:34.260 --> 03:40.640
So now with this format, for instance, you know, I mean, I can wrap all of this into a format,

03:41.080 --> 03:43.880
a format date.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.020
I think this is the one and then put it all inside there.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.540
And of course, I get rid of that.

03:50.660 --> 03:53.720
I don't want this to be a string asked to come in as it is.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.110
And now we should get something more readable.

03:58.110 --> 03:58.330
All right.

03:58.370 --> 04:07.760
So this should be something hopefully that says Wednesday, November 30, 1st or 30th, something like

04:07.760 --> 04:08.030
this.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.820
Let's let's take a look and see if you're run.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.280
OK, there we go.

04:13.490 --> 04:18.980
Tuesday, November 30th, which is today when you run this, of course, depending on the day you are

04:19.400 --> 04:20.420
writing this code.

04:20.550 --> 04:23.540
Of course, this will change, but it will be the correct date for you as well.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.230
Don't get too hung up on this.

04:25.250 --> 04:28.000
This is just some functions that I've created.

04:28.070 --> 04:31.390
You'll have access to that and you can tweak them and so forth.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.930
So something to for you to have.

04:33.290 --> 04:37.460
And we are going to be using these other different functions later.

04:37.670 --> 04:44.120
Well, next, we're going to add the actual temperature of the day, which is exactly what we accidentally

04:44.120 --> 04:45.260
did earlier.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.860
Well, all of that is going to be in here right in this text.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.750
So I'm going to say data or date data rate data.

04:54.920 --> 04:55.250
All right.

04:55.310 --> 05:04.580
List get the first item of the list, which is today and I'm going to say temp and day like the highest

05:04.580 --> 05:05.270
of the day.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.930
And in this case here, let's go ahead.

05:09.110 --> 05:13.670
And what I'm going to do because I don't want to have let's go back here.

05:15.170 --> 05:18.080
I don't want this temp to have decimal points.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.540
What I'm going to do, I'm going to use again.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.750
Let's go back to our util.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.650
We're going to use the format to decimal.

05:27.690 --> 05:32.630
So what this does is it takes in a double and then returns a string formatted.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.540
So this is how we're going to format it.

05:34.550 --> 05:37.520
We just say we want to zero decimal places, right?

05:37.820 --> 05:40.490
That's how we do it and we pass the item, which is a dipole.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.340
So we're going to use that format decimals.

05:44.390 --> 05:45.350
So go back.

05:45.620 --> 05:51.020
I can't wrap all of this again into format decimals like this.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.000
OK.

05:52.080 --> 05:52.820
Which should be good.

05:54.680 --> 06:02.030
And while I'm here this snow, where do we get that snow, which is a description of what's going on

06:02.960 --> 06:03.560
that day?

06:15.370 --> 06:19.930
Well, we do the same thing when I say data analyst.

06:23.270 --> 06:30.560
First item, I'm going to go to, whether I get the first again and then main.

06:31.430 --> 06:35.840
So looking at our data, I got to list get the first one.

06:36.560 --> 06:41.840
I go all the way to whether it's indeed a list or an array.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.430
I get the first object right?

06:43.760 --> 06:44.660
And then I go to mine.

06:44.660 --> 06:48.230
So I'm going to get this small description, not the main description.

06:54.510 --> 06:55.920
One thing I can do.

06:56.670 --> 07:04.230
Actually, it's notice that I see a lot of data lists zero, so I can actually refactor this right click,

07:04.740 --> 07:05.080
right?

07:05.130 --> 07:13.350
Maybe it's a little bit extreme, but it's OK when I introduce whatever, replace all occurrences.

07:15.090 --> 07:15.510
There we go.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.400
So this is just makes it a little bit easier.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.470
Well, the weather item, which just pass in there and just a little bit of refactoring.

07:22.530 --> 07:22.980
Nothing.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.840
Nothing out of this world.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.960
OK, let's go ahead and re1 this real quick.

07:32.080 --> 07:41.080
Now, let me add the degree, as you see here, we have this degree similar now to type a degree symbol.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.400
What do you need to do?

07:42.430 --> 07:45.520
Let's go back to where I want this to show.

07:47.440 --> 07:54.110
This ad plus here, so on Mac, all I do out and hit the zero, and there we go.

07:54.770 --> 07:58.760
And I believe that also that would work on.

07:59.720 --> 08:07.460
P.C. Now, one thing you can do is you can just Google how to type degree symbol right on a Mac or on

08:07.920 --> 08:09.950
a window, and that should work, right?

08:09.980 --> 08:16.190
So this will just help a little bit and let's finalize and give a final version for now so we can move

08:16.190 --> 08:16.480
on.

08:18.530 --> 08:19.220
OK, there we go.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.260
37 degrees and.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.250
If we change this city, we should.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.840
Of course, this should work.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.370
I'm going to say.

08:29.070 --> 08:29.820
Lisbon.

08:33.580 --> 08:41.200
OK, looks like Lisbon is pretty cloudy, 58 degrees, let's say Istanbul.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.420
I think that's how you spell it.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.330
OK, there we go.

08:46.630 --> 08:50.200
57 And it's kind of sunny and rainy and cloudy.

08:51.310 --> 08:51.670
All right.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.170
So it's working.

08:53.440 --> 09:00.280
This is really great because you can see as we change the city, we automatically changing the App Bar

09:00.640 --> 09:01.240
title.

09:01.690 --> 09:05.650
We also getting the date of today, the weather data of today.

09:06.010 --> 09:06.880
We're getting the image.

09:07.210 --> 09:11.090
We're getting the degrees, the temperature and the description right.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.270
It's rain, snow and so forth.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.140
Very good.

09:15.170 --> 09:17.240
So we're making progress now.

09:17.270 --> 09:20.570
Our top here, it's all working perfectly.

09:21.110 --> 09:24.230
Max, what are we going to do is look at this structure here.

09:25.550 --> 09:26.630
OK, I'll see you next.

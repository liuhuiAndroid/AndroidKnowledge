00:00.210 --> 00:08.350
So as we have it now, the Jet Note app is working great so it can add items and save them.

00:08.370 --> 00:09.910
They are all being saved.

00:09.910 --> 00:13.030
We can click and we can also click.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.050
We can delete those items so everything is good.

00:16.440 --> 00:22.170
However, we're not able to persist this data, these notes into a database or somewhere.

00:22.380 --> 00:25.320
So that is something that we need to do.

00:25.380 --> 00:31.470
Next, we are going to be putting together the infrastructure needed to be able to persist data to save

00:31.590 --> 00:32.190
this data.

00:32.670 --> 00:35.450
OK, because now we just have, you know, cache memory here.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.270
And that's not scalable.

00:37.290 --> 00:42.580
That's not what we want, want to be able to actually have an app that when we get out of this app,

00:42.660 --> 00:43.190
come back.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.440
Next time, we'll have persisted the data we've entered.

00:46.470 --> 00:51.390
So this will take us to a different realm of development, which is databases.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.680
Let's go ahead and take a look at how can we persist or save data in Android?

WEBVTT

00:01.570 --> 00:04.100
So this is how the update screen should look like.

00:04.120 --> 00:07.690
OK, so we're going to have, of course, the book in a little bit of information about it, the title

00:08.350 --> 00:09.280
author and the date.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.960
This was published.

00:11.350 --> 00:16.180
And of course, we're going to have a form here that allows users to add their thoughts about the book

00:16.180 --> 00:16.780
as they're reading.

00:17.230 --> 00:22.330
And most importantly, we can also have start in reading Marcus, read in reading and update and delete

00:22.330 --> 00:24.280
the book right if they want to delete the book.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.650
So this is the main structure.

00:28.000 --> 00:28.270
All right.

00:28.270 --> 00:31.750
So instead of having this, what do we have here?

00:31.750 --> 00:32.980
So that was just for testing.

00:33.490 --> 00:42.010
Alice, I'm going to actually create a surface and parsing modifier modifiers such and I say padding

00:42.430 --> 00:46.580
too deep and they say, Dot feel max.

00:47.020 --> 00:59.740
When I past shape, circle, shape and give an elevation of about four dpi, then we're going to actually

00:59.740 --> 01:02.680
show book update.

01:03.460 --> 01:12.040
So then we're past our book info, which is going to be our view model that data that value like this?

01:12.340 --> 01:13.600
OK, let's go ahead and create that.

01:19.110 --> 01:28.740
And the other thing we also want to be able to pass is a book ID once a book item I.D. that very good.

01:31.210 --> 01:40.540
Let's go with that, it's called Spanish Book II, the second book I'd like this.

01:40.790 --> 01:41.650
OK, let's go back.

01:42.460 --> 01:47.920
So here I'm going to just go ahead and create a row because I'm going to have this book image.

01:47.920 --> 01:53.380
And then this structure, which of course, is going to be wrapped inside of a column just creating

01:53.380 --> 01:54.040
this structure.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.720
Nothing really crazy here.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.650
So why so throw?

01:58.570 --> 02:08.440
And I'm going to add a spacer life say width for that space is going to be about 43 dpi.

02:12.030 --> 02:18.420
So I say if book info, that data is not no.

02:20.860 --> 02:22.120
When I created column.

02:24.480 --> 02:34.440
Passive modifier, say, padding for deep and then would say vertical.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.060
Arrangement.

02:39.780 --> 02:44.790
And I want it to be center list item, and I'm going to pass a book.

02:47.080 --> 02:51.330
It's going to be equal to book info.

02:52.330 --> 02:53.080
That data.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.260
Just get the first item like this.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.840
And I'm just going to say and book.

03:06.150 --> 03:07.890
And what are we going to do there in West End?

03:07.890 --> 03:16.710
Book that Google IDs I'm checking right is equal to book Item ID songs.

03:17.070 --> 03:23.910
So now I'm comparing the book to getting the ID if it's equal to the idea of the book that we are passing

03:23.910 --> 03:24.160
here.

03:24.180 --> 03:24.960
That's true.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.840
That's the book that we're going to pass there.

03:28.530 --> 03:31.230
And then here, I'm going to have one press

03:33.600 --> 03:37.090
details just going to be equal to empty.

03:37.110 --> 03:37.410
OK.

03:37.620 --> 03:40.310
It's very strange because we haven't created that, but we'll get there.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.840
So let's go ahead and create this composable.

03:44.220 --> 03:48.210
So my credit card, so essentially, I'm just creating this structure there.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.520
OK, let's create a card

03:53.220 --> 03:54.330
passing a modifier.

03:58.900 --> 04:16.240
So I'm going to say this start for deep and for deep top also and bottom, I'm going to change things

04:16.240 --> 04:16.840
a little bit.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.120
It's going to be about eight deep.

04:20.610 --> 04:21.030
OK.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.060
And then I'm going to say that.

04:27.200 --> 04:35.930
Clip and the clip I'm going to use is going to be rounded corners shape in, let's say, 20 dpi in percentage.

04:36.410 --> 04:36.660
OK.

04:36.870 --> 04:45.500
And things that I want to make this clickable if need be, which in this case we're not going to do

04:45.500 --> 04:46.340
anything anyway.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.120
But that's fine.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.750
And Liz, pass elevation about eight dpi.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.010
Very good.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.720
And now we're going to look at the inside, so we created a structure that now we're going to look at

05:00.720 --> 05:01.320
the inside.

05:01.950 --> 05:02.280
All right.

05:02.430 --> 05:07.360
Well, in this case here, I'm going to say image painter.

05:07.770 --> 05:11.220
I'm going to use remember image painter.

05:12.450 --> 05:20.070
And it's going to be data when I say book that's been passing around for Israel to string

05:22.870 --> 05:26.100
in the description here, which is can pass.

05:26.490 --> 05:30.150
Go ahead and pass on all that's fine and pass the modifier.

05:32.810 --> 05:36.200
Height of about 100.

05:36.320 --> 05:47.660
This is the book now the the image with one dpi and padding about four dpi.

05:48.590 --> 05:52.760
So now I'm going to go and create this very cool effect there.

05:53.060 --> 05:57.740
Say rounded corners, shape and top start.

05:59.130 --> 06:06.030
I'm going to say about 120 dpi, so pretty intense and crazy.

06:07.020 --> 06:13.500
All right and top and let's say, how about top bottom?

06:16.940 --> 06:21.520
Bottom and zero dpi.

06:24.470 --> 06:28.280
Bottom start, also zero dpi.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.680
So I'm saying I don't want anything to do with these three corner just there.

06:32.910 --> 06:36.110
OK, and then I'm going to add a column here.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.590
This is where I'm going to add this structure.

06:40.100 --> 06:40.700
All right.

06:42.830 --> 06:43.340
So.

06:44.810 --> 06:45.980
Let's say text.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.660
I'm going to pass a book that title to strain.

06:51.290 --> 06:55.600
Do some styling modifier want padding?

06:57.530 --> 06:58.340
Start.

07:00.470 --> 07:03.340
ATP and and about

07:06.220 --> 07:07.420
ATP as well.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.490
And with.

07:14.640 --> 07:19.150
120 deep font weight.

07:20.370 --> 07:29.040
Why say my bold and max lines about to overflow?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.330
I want this ellipsis.

07:32.370 --> 07:37.050
OK, so I've created this structure there that's created in a text.

07:39.930 --> 07:46.830
So now I'm going to wood pulp book published date two strength style.

07:49.160 --> 07:55.070
By two and modifier to the padding.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.460
Start.

08:01.530 --> 08:05.820
Of pretty much the same eight dpi.

08:08.490 --> 08:12.060
And it's going to be about the same.

08:16.680 --> 08:23.790
Top just want deep bottom.

08:25.370 --> 08:26.690
HDP is such.

08:28.530 --> 08:28.860
OK.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.270
A lot of quoting here.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.610
But that's good.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.350
So we should be good now.

08:34.770 --> 08:35.100
All right.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.560
So it's nothing really out of this world.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.770
So a credit card list which is being called right here.

08:40.770 --> 08:47.880
So we are actually the book that we're passing here of making sure this book is equal to the I.D. of

08:47.880 --> 08:52.350
the Google Book, right that we pass from the previous screen.

08:53.040 --> 08:53.970
And that's it.

08:54.270 --> 08:58.470
Let's go ahead and run so we can see because I think that will make us a little bit happier.

09:00.810 --> 09:01.170
OK.

09:01.890 --> 09:02.790
Let's click on this one.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.010
Whoops.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.370
Looks like I have a problem.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.430
Let's see what the problem might be.

09:09.330 --> 09:09.700
OK?

09:09.720 --> 09:13.620
No such collection contains no element matching the predicate.

09:14.280 --> 09:18.510
We are checking for something that doesn't exist on update screen update.

09:19.460 --> 09:22.610
It's take a look book item ready.

09:23.190 --> 09:27.090
Let's make sure the book item ready they were passing.

09:29.650 --> 09:30.340
A reader.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.170
Here's what we want to pass.

09:34.710 --> 09:38.610
Let's go to our horizontal, have one card pressed.

09:41.130 --> 09:43.770
Maybe this is not what we we looking for here.

09:44.370 --> 09:45.580
I can just pass this book.

09:45.600 --> 09:50.340
That's the problem, because we're just passing a string, which in this case, I think it's just the

09:50.340 --> 09:51.800
title, which is not what he wants.

09:51.800 --> 09:56.550
So this book needs to be a book that Google books.

09:56.820 --> 09:57.240
There we go.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.200
Theta strength.

09:59.070 --> 10:01.050
So that should do the trick.

10:01.620 --> 10:06.960
So remember, in this case here, we're just ignoring this idea because that is just going to be the

10:06.960 --> 10:07.800
title of the book.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.430
We want the add.

10:08.580 --> 10:15.590
So it's a book that we're receiving Google Book I.D. But that's what we're using to check, right?

10:15.870 --> 10:15.990
Just.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.790
If you look around.

10:19.840 --> 10:25.330
To check, uh, let's see, show book there to check here, right?

10:26.620 --> 10:28.960
The IDs so we can get the correct book.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.100
All right.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.030
Let's go and run.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.220
Hopefully this time we get the best results.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.140
Click Voila!

10:39.860 --> 10:40.610
Very nice.

10:41.300 --> 10:48.170
If I click on this programmatic should see there now we have some problems here mostly are just issues

10:48.170 --> 10:49.970
with laying things out.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.160
So let's go and check the suit.

10:52.160 --> 10:58.500
Wrap this inside of a row so we can have more control over it.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.420
And I'm going to get everything, everything, including this column.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.030
OK, so can pull that.

11:06.320 --> 11:12.470
Let's get all of this put inside there and fold now.

11:13.310 --> 11:17.900
And it's a horizontal

11:20.600 --> 11:23.960
arrangement, and that's a start.

11:26.000 --> 11:26.570
All right.

11:26.660 --> 11:30.260
Let's see if this is going to solve our life problems.

11:32.810 --> 11:33.740
OK, there we go.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.300
Now it works.

11:38.290 --> 11:42.520
We're missing a few other things there, but we can add in a second here.

11:43.400 --> 11:43.930
Very good.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.500
Let's see where we go.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.590
What that guy?

11:51.590 --> 11:55.560
OK, so let's I think we're missing the authors.

11:55.580 --> 11:59.960
Let's go and see what the authors I think I did.

12:00.740 --> 12:04.250
OK, so I need to add authors here.

12:04.250 --> 12:13.370
So text essentially is going to be roughly the same as some of these the authors and body to.

12:13.370 --> 12:14.420
That's fine.

12:15.230 --> 12:20.690
And it's a bottom zero dpi and talks can be to just give that nice.

12:22.390 --> 12:22.960
OK.

12:23.050 --> 12:23.380
All right.

12:23.530 --> 12:24.610
I think they should do it.

12:28.710 --> 12:30.600
OK, now looks much better.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.360
Very good.

12:34.140 --> 12:38.700
So this is working now, we still have some work to do, obviously, because we want to, of course,

12:38.700 --> 12:44.670
then add the sections one, two, three, four or five, but we will get there.

12:44.850 --> 12:50.130
But the most important thing is that we have the infrastructure, the base infrastructure set up.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.370
This is really good because think about where we started, we didn't even have anything.

12:54.390 --> 12:55.710
Now we are getting information.

12:55.710 --> 13:02.580
We are able to search for books and add those books to, let's say, money books about money.

13:02.610 --> 13:03.930
What can we learn about money?

13:05.070 --> 13:08.480
OK, I'm going to add this book and I'm going to go back.

13:08.490 --> 13:15.840
And when I see that the book was added right to the end there, I can click on that one of my phone

13:15.840 --> 13:18.810
right now and they can see that to update, right?

13:18.810 --> 13:22.500
So next, we're just going to look at this area at the bottom.

13:23.100 --> 13:23.490
OK.

13:24.210 --> 13:28.020
It's getting real late for me here, but we are making real good progress.

13:28.050 --> 13:35.640
I hope you are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and I still excited and are still learning

13:35.640 --> 13:37.560
a lot as we go through this.

13:38.370 --> 13:38.790
OK.

13:39.100 --> 13:39.840
We're getting there.

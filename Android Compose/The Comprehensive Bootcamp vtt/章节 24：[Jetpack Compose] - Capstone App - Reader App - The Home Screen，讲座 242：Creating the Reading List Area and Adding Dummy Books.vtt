WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:05.810
So now that we have this centerpiece here, because as you see, this is used.

00:07.290 --> 00:08.520
I brought him here as well.

00:08.850 --> 00:15.540
Let's go ahead and finish this structuring of this, the main screen here onto actually getting the

00:15.540 --> 00:18.780
data in this case, books and do all sort of things that we need to do.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.740
OK, so let's go ahead and finish the structure here.

00:23.370 --> 00:26.760
So first, let's go ahead and add this reading list, right?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.240
And then.

00:28.510 --> 00:31.390
This structure at the bottom there, which is going to be a list of books as well.

00:32.140 --> 00:32.530
All right.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.970
Let's close this down.

00:34.420 --> 00:39.790
So we're still before we move forward, let's move things around here because some of these are not

00:40.420 --> 00:42.640
needed in the home.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.840
So I'm going to cut this and go to our component.

00:46.840 --> 00:55.570
In fact, I can just be smarter about this by just say, Command E or control e for windows and look

00:55.570 --> 00:56.220
for components.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.610
Looks like it's right there.

00:58.570 --> 01:03.880
And I'm just going to add that here as well, which means now.

01:05.910 --> 01:06.630
Back in our.

01:08.570 --> 01:09.620
We need to call that.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.120
OK, let's go ahead and.

01:14.790 --> 01:21.900
Import cat, OK, and we can also get rid of our list card and get rid of it, make it better, move

01:21.900 --> 01:23.250
it somewhere else.

01:26.970 --> 01:27.780
In this case.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.200
Here.

01:42.510 --> 01:45.570
OK, looks like we need to do something important here.

01:47.130 --> 01:49.380
And, OK, everything should be good.

01:52.870 --> 01:55.930
Back, we need to also import driverless card.

01:56.440 --> 01:56.770
OK.

01:58.050 --> 01:58.410
Very good.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.900
So let's go ahead and run just to make sure that everything is still working perfectly.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.750
OK, so everything's so great, that's great.

02:07.110 --> 02:13.470
All right, let's go ahead and add the this structure here reading list, so I know it's going to be

02:13.470 --> 02:14.280
really easy.

02:14.310 --> 02:16.620
First of all, we have to figure out where we're going to add that.

02:18.030 --> 02:20.280
And also, let's move this guy here.

02:20.310 --> 02:22.800
I don't think it needs to be here.

02:25.940 --> 02:26.870
Let's go back.

02:29.070 --> 02:30.060
And added there.

02:40.420 --> 02:46.150
Let's get rid of some imports here that are no longer needed since we added that class, they're OK.

02:47.350 --> 02:47.670
All right.

02:47.690 --> 02:50.440
It's very good, very good.

02:50.890 --> 02:55.450
So we have this reading right now, area, so what are we going to do, actually?

02:56.170 --> 03:01.450
We're going to call this reading right now inside here.

03:02.230 --> 03:09.640
And then after our row, I'm going to call here reading right now.

03:11.120 --> 03:18.830
The say list of they and just snap controller, because we're going to we are going to change a few

03:18.830 --> 03:19.760
things later anyway.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.920
So let's go ahead and rerun this to make sure we can still see what we need to see.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.010
OK, that's good.

03:32.030 --> 03:36.620
So we just we just restructured a few things because we want separate everything.

03:36.630 --> 03:39.800
That way, we can add more things inside of our Rigney right now.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.310
So so far we're just going to pass this list card so we can see things working.

03:43.820 --> 03:44.120
All right.

03:44.780 --> 03:47.990
So let's go to where this is being called there.

03:48.260 --> 03:57.410
What do we do next is I'm going to pass the title section again and label this time is going to be reading

03:58.220 --> 03:58.740
list.

03:58.820 --> 04:03.680
So what I'm doing, I'm really using that composable, which we used earlier, and now I'm going to

04:03.680 --> 04:06.410
pass it down here to have this reading list like this.

04:06.980 --> 04:07.400
All right.

04:08.780 --> 04:11.510
And then here I'm going to put another.

04:15.140 --> 04:20.840
And then here is where I'm going to put this other section here, which is going to contain this, so

04:20.840 --> 04:24.500
I'm going to say book list area.

04:25.520 --> 04:29.690
Getting my say list of books you say.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.570
Empty list for now.

04:33.350 --> 04:38.840
It's going to be an empty list of books because these are the types that we need and they don't pass

04:38.840 --> 04:41.750
if you model which you will see later, I say view model.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.700
All right, and then let's pass it NAF controller here as well.

04:50.550 --> 04:55.520
All right, let's go ahead and create this composable at the bottom here.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.460
OK, so there we have it.

04:58.610 --> 05:00.410
So what is going to happen here?

05:00.920 --> 05:03.590
So we're going to have, of course, a list of books shown there.

05:04.130 --> 05:10.280
What I'm going to do here, I'm going to actually call a horizontal scrollable.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.890
Component that we will create in a second here.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.650
So for this, I'm just going to pass books.

05:23.070 --> 05:26.580
Might just list of books as such and.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.750
And that's it for now, let's go ahead and actually create this other composable as well there.

05:36.200 --> 05:36.500
All right.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.380
So here is the component.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.780
Let me go ahead and.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.780
Refactor this component.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.610
So what am I going to do here?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.510
Well, first of all, I'm going to create a scrollable view.

05:51.520 --> 06:01.270
So when I say foul scrollable or scroll scroll state like, say like such and let's say, remember scroll

06:01.360 --> 06:01.960
state.

06:03.550 --> 06:04.060
Like this?

06:05.240 --> 06:05.530
OK.

06:06.380 --> 06:11.660
And then I'm going to say row, because all of this is going to be inside of a row.

06:12.060 --> 06:12.340
OK.

06:14.970 --> 06:27.780
Add a modifier fail Max with and then I'm going to give it a height of about 280 DB, so I'm creating

06:27.780 --> 06:34.210
this structure here where we're going to have scrollable view, OK, once I have that.

06:34.230 --> 06:35.040
Let's see what else.

06:35.340 --> 06:35.750
Right?

06:35.760 --> 06:42.120
Because it's a row, I want to make sure that also I pass the horizontal scroll state, which I'm going

06:42.120 --> 06:44.580
to pass the scroll state as such.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.630
Well, for now, what I'm going to do, we're going to do a lot of other things later.

06:48.630 --> 06:55.170
But for now, I'm just going to create a for here, I'm going to say book in books.

06:55.530 --> 07:00.690
I think the list of books, that's what we called it, and I'm going to just go ahead and create that

07:00.690 --> 07:01.680
list card.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.650
And pass that book.

07:08.530 --> 07:09.070
Like this?

07:10.850 --> 07:11.070
Right?

07:11.650 --> 07:18.250
And for each one of these cards, remember this card has if you have over it, we have that on press

07:18.250 --> 07:18.790
detail.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.180
So we want to make sure that when that is clicked, we do something right.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.170
So I can't say on card press.

07:24.190 --> 07:27.340
In fact, I can add this right here.

07:30.390 --> 07:39.330
On hard pressed, it's going to be expecting a string of some type later and it's going to just be a

07:39.330 --> 07:40.260
unit like this.

07:41.580 --> 07:41.880
All right.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.510
So now I'm going to pass delegate that event.

07:45.510 --> 07:47.970
So on Card pressed.

07:49.220 --> 07:54.290
I'm going to pass that it like that and we'll get there later.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.400
This is not the end.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.900
We will have more to do later.

07:57.830 --> 08:02.630
OK, so this on card now in our Always-On tool.

08:03.200 --> 08:08.740
So now in our book list area, I add it is horizontal scrollable component here.

08:08.750 --> 08:19.220
Of course, I can go ahead later, do something, say to do one, click on card clicked.

08:20.180 --> 08:23.840
Go to details OK, or navigate.

08:28.490 --> 08:32.930
OK, so just for testing, let's go ahead and see where this is being called right about here.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.820
Just remove that.

08:34.820 --> 08:37.280
I guess what I'm going to do.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.470
I did tap here in our home content.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.480
Let's go ahead and say something like this off.

08:41.480 --> 08:49.760
Our list of books can be a list of books, and I'm going to be equal to say he's equal to a list of

08:50.270 --> 08:51.620
well past few books here.

08:52.220 --> 08:55.040
So first one, I'm going to say am book.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.360
Let's keep in it.

09:02.090 --> 09:02.990
Some gibberish

09:05.690 --> 09:07.550
and title.

09:09.770 --> 09:11.030
Hello again.

09:13.190 --> 09:22.970
Sirs, all of us and notes, we know we don't need anything, just put it all like this.

09:23.070 --> 09:26.520
OK, let's copy and a few.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.610
So that doesn't matter.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.050
There's going to be again, it's going to be hello.

09:34.340 --> 09:34.970
And that's fine.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.170
So now we have a list of books and then we can pass this list of books.

09:42.310 --> 09:50.830
Here sort of empty list, just past that list of books, and that is indeed what's going to be received

09:50.830 --> 09:51.940
in our book list.

09:52.060 --> 09:52.810
List of books.

09:52.810 --> 09:59.830
And then we're going to go past that into horizontal scroll view component, which is going to go and

09:59.980 --> 10:01.780
look through and create a cart.

10:01.990 --> 10:07.570
OK, a lot of moving parts, but essentially what we're doing here is that we added, or let's make

10:07.570 --> 10:08.500
sure I open this.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.850
Essentially, we're going to do here is that we are adding this structure at the bottom here, and we

10:12.850 --> 10:17.860
just want to see a list of books, even though there are the same books want to see them showing here.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.890
All right, let's go ahead and run this real quick and see.

10:21.550 --> 10:22.270
Hopefully it works.

10:23.620 --> 10:24.310
And there you have it.

10:24.730 --> 10:28.600
So now you have a few books that are showing at the bottom there.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.360
Oh, this is so great.

10:33.520 --> 10:39.610
All right, just like that, we have something, in fact that looks exactly like what we have here and

10:39.610 --> 10:40.600
we have that functionality.

10:40.990 --> 10:47.260
The beauty now is that since we have this all set up, it will be way easier than because all we need

10:47.260 --> 10:50.080
to do now is look for data and the data will come later.

10:50.080 --> 10:56.610
But at least we have the infrastructure set up so that once we are able to search for books and add

10:56.610 --> 11:01.690
the books in the ribs and retrieve them, then they can just all have to do, of course, is to get

11:01.690 --> 11:08.170
that information, the data of our books and populate passing it through, just like we did passing

11:08.170 --> 11:10.570
through this list of books in our code.

11:11.140 --> 11:11.890
And then we're done.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.260
And then we should see reflected here.

11:14.620 --> 11:17.260
And if I click, nothing will happen.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.820
But at least we all know that we're clicking the right book.

11:19.900 --> 11:20.740
And let's see.

11:20.770 --> 11:21.190
Let's see.

11:21.190 --> 11:27.520
We want to make sure that when that book is clicked, we pass that item of whatever that book has been

11:27.520 --> 11:27.910
clicked.

11:27.940 --> 11:29.170
What is I want to pass here?

11:29.220 --> 11:29.770
This is it.

11:29.910 --> 11:34.300
It's going to be the strength of the book and see what is it?

11:34.330 --> 11:35.110
Let's go.

11:35.120 --> 11:35.830
I had.

11:37.090 --> 11:39.910
And where this is called right here.

11:40.390 --> 11:43.510
Let's see if we can say log I logged like this.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.210
And passed it.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.560
In this case, it's let's run this real quick.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.700
OK, let's click this book of couple of times.

11:58.700 --> 12:01.880
It's slow to look at this one again.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.950
Looks like something is not right here.

12:04.370 --> 12:04.700
OK?

12:06.270 --> 12:07.050
There we go.

12:07.800 --> 12:13.860
Let's click says hello again, so it's getting the title of the book that we're clicking, clicking,

12:13.860 --> 12:17.340
so I was click on my phone there to say this book title.

12:17.610 --> 12:19.410
Click it says book title.

12:19.410 --> 12:20.970
But we didn't change something.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.390
Let's go back to work hard.

12:22.410 --> 12:25.890
That's why it's not reflecting the actual titles of the book.

12:26.190 --> 12:29.190
So if you go back to our card?

12:30.550 --> 12:31.480
Liscard.

12:34.990 --> 12:37.810
Right here, of course, we're going to just pass the book object.

12:38.050 --> 12:38.410
There we go.

12:38.750 --> 12:48.460
It's a book that title like that, and for authors, we need to make this an olive oil and wrap that

12:49.240 --> 12:50.770
just say to string, that's fine.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.860
And for our authors, say book.

12:55.740 --> 13:05.840
Authors to screen and which should be good now actually reflect the objects that we're passing.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.110
All the books are passing.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.360
You can see the change now in our books.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.100
But now we got all this.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.320
Hello, everything, it's great.

13:13.830 --> 13:17.040
If you click any of these, you can see LOLCat.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.800
We're going to get the corrected reflection here.

13:20.820 --> 13:23.550
Let's show you just look at the bottom here.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.800
But hello again.

13:27.550 --> 13:28.600
How about this one?

13:29.770 --> 13:34.690
It's not doing anything because we didn't wrap it with the new component.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.550
It's OK, but there we go.

13:37.270 --> 13:38.740
It's indeed working.

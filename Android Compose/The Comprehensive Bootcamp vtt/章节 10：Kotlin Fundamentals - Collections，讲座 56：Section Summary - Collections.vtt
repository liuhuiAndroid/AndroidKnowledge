00:01.020 --> 00:02.950
So in this section, we have learned a lot.

00:03.000 --> 00:09.720
We've talked about collections, we now understand what a collection is and most importantly, we understand

00:09.720 --> 00:12.960
that there are immutable and immutable collections, right?

00:13.110 --> 00:19.020
So we learn how to invoke methods on lists in this case or a collection to do things for us.

00:19.030 --> 00:21.990
All of these comes with Coughlin, which is really helpful.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.850
We learn about sets, which is another type of collection, so it sets and maps and lists.

00:28.740 --> 00:30.720
We learn how to initialize the lists.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.750
We also learn how to create empty collections.

00:34.230 --> 00:39.360
And the last thing we did was learning how to use filters in the collection, which is really powerful,

00:39.360 --> 00:46.320
because then you can cipher through a bunch of data to find certain item or items, for that matter.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.800
So when it comes to collections in Scotland, especially, there's so much you can do.

00:50.850 --> 00:55.800
There's an article I found online called Scotland Collection Functions Cheat Sheet.

00:56.370 --> 00:57.810
So this is really helpful.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.450
It's really popular, as you can see here.

01:01.200 --> 01:07.450
So I would really recommend you actually go and look for this article.

01:07.470 --> 01:11.460
In fact, I'll have a link and the resources for you to take a look.

01:11.730 --> 01:12.690
If not, you can just go.

01:12.690 --> 01:15.540
And Google Scotland collection functions cheat sheet.

01:15.990 --> 01:21.330
The writer really takes the time to explain everything about collections in Scotland and many things

01:21.330 --> 01:23.640
that he can do with collections.

01:23.940 --> 01:28.800
So it's very thorough and I think it will be worth your time.

01:29.130 --> 01:35.160
So go through it, and at the bottom of this article, you will have the actual cheat sheet.

01:35.580 --> 01:38.190
So let's go down and you can have there.

01:38.190 --> 01:41.890
It is a cheat sheet and you can magnify it so he can take a look.

01:41.910 --> 01:47.970
So I really encourage you to take a look at this for, if anything, just so you know the possibilities

01:48.720 --> 01:50.640
with collections and Coughlin.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.020
OK, very good.

01:52.260 --> 01:52.890
Have fun.

01:52.890 --> 01:59.490
I enjoy collections because it is just so much fun, especially when you start creating more advanced

01:59.490 --> 02:00.780
programs or applications.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.460
It's it's really it really gets fun.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.930
OK, very good.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.220
I'll see you next time.

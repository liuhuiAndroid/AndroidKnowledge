WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:01.740
OK, let's continue.

00:01.860 --> 00:05.070
So we have our row here, and it ends right here.

00:05.340 --> 00:13.910
See, right, then I'm going to put comma and then I'm going to say vertical alignment alignment.

00:14.430 --> 00:18.680
Such wind is to be center vertically aligned.

00:18.780 --> 00:19.720
All the items there.

00:19.740 --> 00:23.610
OK, so we should be done now with at least the.

00:24.810 --> 00:29.580
This structure here, right, we have this very nice border there.

00:30.090 --> 00:35.310
Now we have to look at the contents inside, so we have here a radio button and then whoever the text

00:35.400 --> 00:36.280
of that radio button.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.260
So we're going to create that.

00:38.310 --> 00:43.650
So inside here, I'm going to say radio button, there is such function radio button there.

00:43.890 --> 00:47.250
So we have two paths selected and on click it makes sense.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.630
So for the selected here, what do we need to do is we need to look at the state of the answer, meaning

00:55.710 --> 01:00.570
if we go back to our payload, we have a question and we want to get to this answer.

01:01.140 --> 01:01.560
So.

01:02.460 --> 01:08.100
We are going to look at OK, if the answer in this case is Louisiana and we need to figure out OK in

01:08.100 --> 01:08.790
our choices.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.290
Where is Louisiana?

01:11.530 --> 01:17.380
And if that is what was selected, if that's true, then we know that they have gotten the correct answer.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.420
They have selected the correct answer to do that.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.600
We are talking about state, which means we need to retrieve or get that state, which is very important.

01:25.990 --> 01:30.250
So back at the top here, I'm going to create another vowel when I call.

01:31.060 --> 01:32.920
Let's call this answer state.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.720
As such, remember?

01:35.620 --> 01:41.200
And then of course, we are going to use again and the question to drive everything there.

01:41.260 --> 01:46.240
We're going to pass the question, you know, remember five over it says we can pass the item that we

01:46.240 --> 01:47.110
want to calculate.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.220
So you can see here.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.660
So we pass question.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.750
And then and then we going say mutable state.

01:54.940 --> 01:59.110
Of and it's going to be and into time that we're going to be receiving.

01:59.950 --> 02:00.600
We'll see them.

02:00.950 --> 02:04.000
Second, why and that could be notable.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.700
Analysts just say no to start with.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.630
In the beginning to answer, state does not have anything, but we know it's going to be governed,

02:12.930 --> 02:17.940
who is going to be driven by the question because the question answer will have the information we want.

02:17.950 --> 02:21.820
We can access the choices as well as the answer, and we can compare those.

02:22.510 --> 02:28.780
So now you will understand why I have this index that are passing along in our choices because remember,

02:29.770 --> 02:31.840
all these choices are inside of the list.

02:32.410 --> 02:33.580
A list has an index.

02:33.580 --> 02:38.560
So I if I want to check to see if Oklahoma is exactly the answer.

02:38.980 --> 02:42.220
Well, I can see check or choices in this case.

02:43.220 --> 02:44.120
Index zero.

02:44.390 --> 02:49.020
It's going to be Oklahoma, so I'm accessing Oklahoma by state index zero, surpassing zero.

02:49.580 --> 02:56.270
And then I can look up the answer field to see if it's the same as Oklahoma, right, and go through

02:56.270 --> 03:00.080
all of them to find if the user has indeed found the correct answer.

03:00.470 --> 03:01.610
That's why we have this index.

03:01.970 --> 03:06.470
So now what you can do here, instead of a selected right because we have the state, I'm going to say

03:06.470 --> 03:12.500
Answers State it's immutable and we see that value has to be equal to index.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.990
If that is true, then indeed what they've selected is true, which means is correct.

03:18.500 --> 03:23.150
So then on, click here.

03:23.540 --> 03:24.230
What do we do?

03:24.740 --> 03:31.460
We're going to use a function call, update answer and we're going to pass the index.

03:31.490 --> 03:33.920
So this update answer what it will do.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.510
You will as well.

03:35.930 --> 03:40.580
So this applet answer will update the answer to see, OK, now we passed this index and we go to the

03:40.610 --> 03:41.870
next index if need be.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.230
So this applied answer, we need to create it, but you have to.

03:45.230 --> 03:50.600
It's going to be special because it also has to be driven with a state.

03:50.870 --> 03:52.610
So I'm going to go up again.

03:53.180 --> 03:57.950
Let's say vowel update answer as such, and it's going to be a lamp.

03:57.950 --> 04:00.320
They're going to say it like this.

04:00.860 --> 04:02.900
It's going to return nothing.

04:04.580 --> 04:11.320
Let's say that to remember, right, we can also set up and remember with lambdas or with functions

04:11.340 --> 04:12.020
that spirit.

04:12.350 --> 04:12.680
All right.

04:12.710 --> 04:20.690
So in this case here, of course, I'm still going to be governed by our question object question item

04:20.690 --> 04:26.070
with such an insight here, I'm going to create another lambda, which will allow us to then have the

04:26.530 --> 04:31.820
is bit integer there will that is controlling our index to check.

04:32.850 --> 04:34.770
For the correct choice here.

04:36.030 --> 04:42.280
So how do we check for the correct choice to say, OK, if indeed the index is zero and the answers

04:42.300 --> 04:48.660
is Louisiana, which is going to be Oklahoma or in this case, if index is zero one to Louisiana and

04:48.660 --> 04:51.690
the answer is also Louisiana, then that is correct.

04:51.780 --> 04:52.050
Right.

04:52.350 --> 04:53.890
That's what we're trying to do here.

04:53.910 --> 04:55.860
I'm just going to say answer state

04:58.590 --> 04:59.040
value.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.440
I'm going to set that to this.

05:02.250 --> 05:05.730
So we're getting the answer, the correct answer.

05:07.180 --> 05:14.170
By passing in these implicit variable there, which is going to be the which is going to be the index,

05:14.170 --> 05:15.070
the correct index.

05:15.790 --> 05:21.940
So if that's the case, then I'm going to have to check with the choices.

05:22.600 --> 05:27.610
So now I'm going to say the following what's say correct answer?

05:29.310 --> 05:34.320
State, which have we haven't created this go ahead and created just right above here.

05:34.590 --> 05:35.010
Wow.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.830
Correct answer.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.270
State.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.160
I say remember.

05:43.810 --> 05:49.180
So again, we are going to pass a question object.

05:51.160 --> 05:56.500
So I'm going to say it's going to be a mutable state of it's going to be a boolean Typekit as if we

05:56.500 --> 05:57.220
want to check.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.270
We're going to either return true or false as, say, Boolean.

06:01.750 --> 06:05.710
It's going to be knowledgeable and it's going to pass null in the beginning.

06:06.970 --> 06:07.290
OK.

06:07.690 --> 06:10.330
So our correct answer that value.

06:10.970 --> 06:19.120
OK, I'm going to say that two choices state and the choices state is indeed Alice, which means I can

06:19.120 --> 06:20.980
pass index what index?

06:21.050 --> 06:22.510
We're past it.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.580
That's been passed around, right?

06:25.180 --> 06:30.730
And then I'm going to say, if that's equal to question that answer.

06:32.850 --> 06:37.890
So I'm going to go through all the choices states remember these choices state we created here, it's

06:37.890 --> 06:40.850
going to have a mutable list of choices.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.900
Essentially, it's going to have all of these guys here.

06:43.470 --> 06:49.950
And so we're checking here now to see, well, if choices state would pass passing the index, for instance,

06:49.950 --> 06:51.060
indexed one.

06:51.090 --> 06:54.660
That's what they chose to use or chose index one, right?

06:54.930 --> 06:57.420
Which means it's going to be Florida 01, right?

06:57.780 --> 07:04.260
If it's equal to question that answer question that answer Louisiana, then we are setting our correct

07:04.260 --> 07:06.810
answer value bullying to true.

07:07.590 --> 07:13.500
But in this case, you know, this is going to be false because it's not going to be Louisiana where

07:13.680 --> 07:14.970
they have chosen Florida.

07:15.900 --> 07:19.140
That's why then correct answer state values are going to be false.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.500
And then we're going to update that into the update answer.

07:25.850 --> 07:26.450
This makes sense.

07:26.540 --> 07:32.900
So here we are checking to see if the choice that was clicked or selected, it is indeed what.

07:34.120 --> 07:34.840
Is the answer?

07:35.500 --> 07:38.110
If yes, then it's true, if not, then it's false, then we know.

07:39.130 --> 07:40.070
All right, so that happens.

07:40.070 --> 07:41.450
Don't click all there.

07:41.770 --> 07:45.520
The checking I get so is still inside of our radio button.

07:45.640 --> 07:50.080
I'm going to pass a few modifiers here or a modifier should say.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.340
Give her padding.

07:59.050 --> 08:04.480
And let's give a start patting of about 16 deep.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.650
And let's keep colors.

08:11.670 --> 08:17.670
It's beautiful for our radio button colors, in fact, if you have over, you can actually pass the

08:17.670 --> 08:22.290
colors with your button color so it can change things around with our radio buttons.

08:22.920 --> 08:28.050
Radio button default, I should say default defaults that colors.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.400
So we're going to change a few things I see.

08:36.590 --> 08:39.710
Always upends this, so let's get rid of all of that.

08:45.510 --> 08:52.620
And then here we're going to pass, for instance, selector so selected color that is, I want to say

08:52.620 --> 08:53.770
something different.

08:53.790 --> 08:59.550
So I'm going to put an if statement here to say, well, if the answer is correct, then I'm going to

08:59.550 --> 09:02.310
change the color to something else.

09:02.310 --> 09:03.740
Else is going to be another color.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.610
So I'm going to be fine here.

09:06.630 --> 09:17.400
Correct answer state that value is true and index is also.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.090
And index, let's see.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.630
And index.

09:35.230 --> 09:37.360
It's also equal to answer.

09:39.360 --> 09:45.030
States that value that we know all is good, that means we are going to.

09:47.900 --> 09:48.800
Say color.

09:50.140 --> 09:57.570
Dark green, you know, say, copy and change the alpha here, so it's a little bit dimmer, zero dark

09:57.610 --> 10:01.000
to f like that.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.380
And they else.

10:08.810 --> 10:17.100
That means something is not right is false, and I say color that red and dim it down a little bit with

10:17.120 --> 10:17.690
alpha.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.580
Also, zero down to Earth like this.

10:31.310 --> 10:36.950
Remember this in this for loop, for each index, we still have to answer text.

10:37.280 --> 10:43.190
That means we still have this text that we can add to show something like this.

10:43.190 --> 10:49.280
So we've created a structure here and the radio button now we can go ahead and show the actual text.

10:49.310 --> 10:57.050
So for now, all of that will happen where remember, we still inside a red button and right after which

10:57.050 --> 11:00.830
is actually a radio button, you can see ends there in this.

11:01.910 --> 11:12.470
Radio button and right here and radio button right here, let's put a text for now so we can see.

11:14.660 --> 11:15.800
So let's go ahead and say.

11:18.670 --> 11:20.470
Answer text.

11:23.190 --> 11:23.590
All right.

11:23.610 --> 11:25.440
So for now, this should be good.

11:25.530 --> 11:28.440
Let's go ahead and make sure that this is called somewhere.

11:29.490 --> 11:34.560
And I'm going to just not add anything for those.

11:35.610 --> 11:37.230
That way, we don't run into issues.

11:39.220 --> 11:39.670
OK.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.420
So going back to questions composable there.

11:45.690 --> 11:46.980
Get rid of all of this.

11:47.160 --> 11:51.210
So once everything is good, I'm going to.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.590
Put in if set me here just to be safe and we're safe.

11:56.910 --> 11:59.550
Questions, questions.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.540
Is not known.

12:07.390 --> 12:11.170
That's true, then I'm going to go ahead and invoke the questions.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.780
Display and pass.

12:16.890 --> 12:21.540
Our questions as such, so hearing this question.

12:22.970 --> 12:28.670
And first, just to get the first one, that's fine, because that's what we need.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.180
OK, for now.

12:31.830 --> 12:36.510
And let's go ahead and run this, hopefully to see if we are able to see something.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.710
Let's go ahead and run this and they have it.

12:41.100 --> 12:44.940
OK, so we have a first question, as you see here.

12:44.970 --> 12:46.560
What's the meaning of all this?

12:47.940 --> 12:48.330
Forget.

12:48.450 --> 12:54.180
So this is real good, but seems like I'm not getting the correct text, right?

12:54.190 --> 12:58.890
I'm not getting the correct question, I should say, because the question should be this one.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.270
What is the problem?

13:00.270 --> 13:00.570
What?

13:00.960 --> 13:04.560
OK, let's go back to our trivia home.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.940
No actually questions.

13:07.380 --> 13:11.730
And right below we're passing the question question item.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.980
Right, there we go.

13:16.010 --> 13:20.270
That's the problem, because here should we be calling question?

13:23.130 --> 13:25.350
That question is section.

13:26.280 --> 13:31.110
OK, so I'm getting the question object and invoking the question properly.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.390
Let's try it again.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.860
And notice that we should see a little circle.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.820
There you go, it's thinking, and voila.

13:41.970 --> 13:49.320
So LDL F2 was banned in Australia, and we can't either say, Well, see, it even works now because

13:49.320 --> 13:51.030
it says this is not false.

13:51.570 --> 13:52.850
So this is wrong.

13:52.860 --> 13:57.180
If I go through and he can see it changed colour, it's quite hard to see.

13:57.510 --> 13:58.260
But the.

13:58.420 --> 14:03.780
But if you run this on your emulator, you can see that that should show the correct colour, which

14:03.780 --> 14:05.670
is some sort of green.

14:06.240 --> 14:06.550
OK.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.450
So it's again.

14:09.500 --> 14:14.570
Of course, we're just getting one answer or one question because we have a hard coded everything.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.120
So click can see there is that green there.

14:17.780 --> 14:19.430
All right, so this is working.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.340
Of course, there are a few things we need to change.

14:21.350 --> 14:26.810
For instance, the background, we see that white there, but that's that's just cosmetics, and we

14:26.810 --> 14:28.790
can always work on that and change that.

14:29.150 --> 14:32.240
But at least now we know things are working.

14:32.520 --> 14:37.520
We know that when we click, we are checking to see if something is valid.

14:37.750 --> 14:42.530
If the question or if the answer is correct, if it's false, then of course we have the right.

14:42.530 --> 14:44.660
As you saw here, click on false.

14:44.870 --> 14:45.980
This is incorrect.

14:46.010 --> 14:46.700
That's why it's red.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.460
All right, so we're making good progress.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.450
So go ahead and rewatch this videos if there is something that you didn't quite get.

14:53.780 --> 14:57.260
If you have questions, of course you know what to do, but it's fairly simple.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.770
Straightforward, really, if you think about it, the logic at least.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.090
OK, very good.

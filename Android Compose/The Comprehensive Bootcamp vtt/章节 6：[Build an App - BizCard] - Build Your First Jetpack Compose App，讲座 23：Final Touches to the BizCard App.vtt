WEBVTT

00:00.460 --> 00:07.690
Now that we have our basic infrastructure created, so we know that we can tackle the portfolio here

00:07.690 --> 00:10.090
to show and to hide, which is really awesome.

00:10.300 --> 00:14.050
We want to now work internally, so we want something like this.

00:14.060 --> 00:20.140
You know, this is not this is not exciting, right, to show, yes, this text like I want to do.

00:20.510 --> 00:25.120
I want to create something that's more customized and beautiful, if you will.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.200
How do we do this?

00:26.710 --> 00:29.200
Well, inside of out of here.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.300
In fact, before I even leave you, let's go ahead and get rid of the unnecessary here.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.460
Just a box concise.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.260
So let's go back to our content.

00:38.800 --> 00:44.230
You say command entry is going to take you there or control Class B and windows.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.690
And let's go to our portfolio again.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.380
Quick.

00:47.950 --> 00:48.600
And there we go.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.710
So this is where we are going to be working on.

00:50.770 --> 00:57.010
So what we want to do is we want to be able to extract and make something a little bit more memorable

00:57.430 --> 00:58.510
and less embarrassing.

00:58.990 --> 00:59.440
OK.

00:59.770 --> 01:00.070
All right.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.360
So what are we going to do?

01:01.390 --> 01:06.520
Let's get rid of that item there as serve us well, and we're going to go back to sleep mode and we're

01:06.520 --> 01:09.670
going to hide our emulator such.

01:10.880 --> 01:16.520
And for the content, I'm actually going to get rid of the preview because I want to see that more.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.780
And what I'm going to do inside here is going to tweet the card and let it pass modifier.

01:23.810 --> 01:24.620
What's new?

01:26.390 --> 01:37.970
Your general pattern of about 13 deep and feel max width such and then I'm going to pass a shape in

01:37.970 --> 01:45.590
this case is going to be a rectangle shape as such because I want it to be that shape, rectangle shape.

01:46.190 --> 01:46.670
Very good.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.740
Now, if you look at what is inside here.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.040
Notice we have some sort of two configurations.

01:53.060 --> 01:57.090
First, we have a row because things are going to be left right.

01:57.110 --> 02:01.220
And of course, here we also have things are going to be vertically aligned.

02:01.230 --> 02:02.450
So top to bottom.

02:03.110 --> 02:09.860
So the main enclosing item will be a row because I'm going to be this item, which is going to be our

02:09.860 --> 02:10.700
profile picture.

02:10.940 --> 02:15.800
And then we have this content project title and then description of sorts.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.220
So what are we going to do inside of our card?

02:19.250 --> 02:21.140
That would be that we will be creating.

02:21.470 --> 02:24.260
We're going to create a row or add a row.

02:24.650 --> 02:26.240
All of these is given, OK.

02:26.690 --> 02:30.920
And then I'm going to pass the modifier again, say modifier.

02:31.310 --> 02:35.930
And I want padding within inside there, padding inside.

02:35.930 --> 02:37.790
And I see about eight dpi.

02:38.150 --> 02:41.750
And next to one is also say background color.

02:42.080 --> 02:48.070
I'm just going to use the material theme that colors and just use the surface color.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.630
All of these colors are come from the mature theme.

02:50.990 --> 02:51.950
So we're set.

02:52.340 --> 02:52.670
All right.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.070
And then I'm going to make this clickable.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.680
And next, I'm going to also add padding.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.670
This is inside of our row of about 16 dpi.

03:01.670 --> 03:02.210
Like this?

03:03.020 --> 03:03.400
All right.

03:03.410 --> 03:08.300
So we have this row created now we have to add these contents.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.630
So we're going to use a surface again.

03:10.640 --> 03:18.020
A very good friend of ours, passing modifier size and turning the whole thing to have about 15 dpi

03:18.200 --> 03:18.680
such.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.990
And then I'm going to use the shape of the shape and I want a circle shape.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.750
But now what are we trying to do here?

03:26.780 --> 03:32.870
Well, all we're trying to do is to add this nice circle containing an image.

03:33.260 --> 03:33.800
What do you mean it?

03:34.190 --> 03:35.690
Haven't we done that before?

03:36.140 --> 03:42.440
If you look back to have our content, of course, if you look back at this, go back to here.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.180
We have this create image profile.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.530
That's exactly what you want.

03:45.770 --> 03:47.690
Here is the beauty we can reuse.

03:47.900 --> 03:51.890
Pieces of the user interface are interesting.

03:52.100 --> 03:56.030
That means then I don't have to come here and we do all of this.

03:56.390 --> 04:03.140
All I can do, which is see, I can go ahead and just call the create image profile as such and see

04:03.140 --> 04:03.770
what happens.

04:04.010 --> 04:09.110
I'm going to go ahead and make sure that I run this real quick to see what's going to happen.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.230
OK, so it's false.

04:11.230 --> 04:13.510
So we need to click to see something right?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.020
That's the deal.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.790
I'm going to go ahead and click and voila.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.880
Now make sure this is there.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.490
You can see I can scroll up and down in.

04:22.490 --> 04:26.990
Each one of these are going to show or have an actual.

04:26.990 --> 04:31.010
In this case, you can see an actual image rounded and everything.

04:31.940 --> 04:39.290
This is the beauty of creating pieces of independent function, in this case, composable because we

04:39.290 --> 04:40.070
can reuse them.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.870
Now here is the awesome part.

04:41.870 --> 04:48.170
Also, if we go to our create image profile notice, we passed the modifier vertical.

04:48.200 --> 04:53.900
This is good because that means even though it is not required, it's optional.

04:54.230 --> 04:56.450
We can actually use that to our advantage.

04:57.230 --> 05:03.590
How well I'm going to change a few things here because notice in the side of this create image profile

05:04.070 --> 05:08.840
the only place I reuse whatever we're going to be passing here in this case, it might fire is just

05:08.840 --> 05:16.220
on this surface, which is the overall the main canvas for our create in profile, this guy.

05:16.760 --> 05:17.630
That's where we're using.

05:17.930 --> 05:19.550
However, we don't use it anywhere else.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.770
So I want to use that also here.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.860
Just call that modifier as such.

05:25.580 --> 05:26.870
This is going to help me.

05:26.870 --> 05:27.770
In what way?

05:27.800 --> 05:30.630
Well, let's go back to where this has been called.

05:30.650 --> 05:37.700
Now we have a couple of places, so we have here where which is inside of our list.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.410
What is that one to happen?

05:39.440 --> 05:44.930
Well, we want to make sure that we pass, modify here to further customize our friend.

05:45.350 --> 05:45.830
Look at that.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.220
I can see modifier that size when I make it a little bit smaller.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.100
How about 100?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.270
Let's see what's going to happen.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.530
That deep?

05:55.250 --> 05:56.210
Let's see what's going to happen.

05:56.570 --> 05:57.380
And look at this.

05:57.410 --> 05:59.990
Now it's smaller than this guy, you see.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.520
This is wonderful.

06:01.700 --> 06:06.710
This is an amazing concept that you will see me use this over and over again.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.300
In fact, that's what's encouraged.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.140
That's the beauty.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.020
Now we're taking we created this great image profile a while ago.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.710
It has its own customized properties.

06:16.010 --> 06:21.440
But then we can customize it even further because we want it to be reusable anywhere we want.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.670
And here's the example, and we can continue customizing.

06:25.930 --> 06:31.330
Because we just we can pass any modifier that we want here or any property from our modifier.

06:31.990 --> 06:32.530
Wonderful.

06:32.920 --> 06:39.100
And as such, I can come down here just to show you I'm going to say text and because remember it was

06:39.100 --> 06:45.250
still inside of these lazy column, which means we have this item object here and this case just a string

06:45.250 --> 06:47.320
that we can show text there.

06:47.830 --> 06:53.170
Or I can just go ahead and just pass the actual item, say item like this same thing.

06:53.500 --> 07:00.280
We can pass named parameters or we can just say like this and pass item, which is the recommended way.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.270
Either way, it will work.

07:01.540 --> 07:01.890
All right.

07:01.900 --> 07:08.300
So now if I run this again and let's click, we should see project in each one.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.080
It's going to go in show here.

07:11.650 --> 07:12.160
All right.

07:12.790 --> 07:19.090
And if you look closely, you will see that we have this very nice card, which we created just a few

07:19.090 --> 07:19.780
seconds ago.

07:20.140 --> 07:27.340
And as we know, for each card, we can also pass the elevation right of a shape.

07:27.350 --> 07:30.730
I'm going to see elevation for type DPI.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.080
And there you go.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.400
You can see the difference there.

07:33.610 --> 07:35.860
We have this very nice elevation there.

07:36.130 --> 07:42.010
How about changing this to about seven dpi for our row just to make sure?

07:42.730 --> 07:43.020
All right.

07:43.040 --> 07:43.750
Much, much better.

07:43.780 --> 07:44.260
I like that.

07:44.530 --> 07:49.270
I guess we can play around with this patterns and all sort of things, but at least you can see now

07:49.450 --> 07:51.640
that things are working as expected.

07:52.270 --> 07:55.150
Now the other thing I'm going to do here.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.790
Remember, we are trying to make it so that we have something like this.

07:57.790 --> 08:03.280
So that means then this text here perhaps needs to change to something a little bit more exciting.

08:03.550 --> 08:09.580
So the first thing we do, let's change the font weight and we say font weight bold.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.620
So if you just start typing as such.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.920
So here I'm just say bold font weight, bold enter.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.630
And there it is.

08:16.930 --> 08:22.300
But again, remember that the idea is to have we have this one row, which we've added, so we have

08:22.300 --> 08:27.320
a row which contains this create image profile and they don't have the text.

08:27.640 --> 08:33.730
But if we add, anything else is going to be added to the right, but we want something to be added

08:33.730 --> 08:34.920
after this project.

08:35.060 --> 08:35.860
Like a bottom here.

08:35.870 --> 08:36.610
How do we do that?

08:36.700 --> 08:42.100
Well, we are going to enclose this text inside of a column.

08:42.310 --> 08:49.870
So I'm going to say column such and I'm going to select this guy and I'm going to arrow up what's selected

08:49.870 --> 08:55.210
while still holding command shift like this is going to go now inside.

08:55.780 --> 08:56.080
All right.

08:56.080 --> 09:00.250
So now we have this column here, which is exactly what we want and what we can do.

09:00.370 --> 09:09.100
Of course, I'm going to go ahead and pass a modifier here, another padding of about eight dpi or seven

09:09.100 --> 09:09.460
dpi.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.240
That's fine.

09:10.750 --> 09:16.540
And then still with our modifier, I'm going to also invoke the line limited there.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.800
The align method.

09:17.800 --> 09:23.680
In this case, I'm going to pass alignment, of course, and the alignment to say alignment, and I

09:23.680 --> 09:27.010
want this alignment to be centered vertically.

09:27.280 --> 09:32.470
So this will allow this whole column to enclose everything that is inside of it.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.500
It's going to be center vertically, which is exactly what we want.

09:35.890 --> 09:36.220
Very good.

09:36.220 --> 09:41.260
So we have in our text, the next thing we want to add is, of course, some sort of description here,

09:41.260 --> 09:42.130
something like that.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.170
So that means then we just copy this and paste it all there.

09:47.170 --> 09:51.940
And in this case, I'm just going to add a text manual text.

09:51.940 --> 09:55.960
It was a great project, something like that.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.960
And for font, it's not going to be bold.

09:58.960 --> 10:08.770
I want to change this to something less bold, no pun intended, let's say style and what's called material

10:09.280 --> 10:10.300
theme or such.

10:10.870 --> 10:15.970
Let's go to typography and then Body two is a little bit small.

10:16.510 --> 10:17.170
That should work.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.370
Let's go give it a run.

10:18.910 --> 10:19.300
All right.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.580
Let's go ahead and take a look.

10:21.700 --> 10:28.750
You can click and you see we have everything working nice, right?

10:29.350 --> 10:29.940
I did.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.090
And we have our rose and everything is looking great.

10:34.540 --> 10:40.750
Now, keep in mind that if we change this alignment or we don't add this alignment, this project one

10:40.750 --> 10:44.440
and great project, you know, this tax here would be to the top here.

10:44.440 --> 10:50.530
In fact, let me show you real quick what would happen if we don't have that run?

10:51.160 --> 10:55.120
OK, let's go portfolio and you can see is at the top there.

10:55.390 --> 11:01.210
It's not the worst thing in the world, but I want everything to be kind of centered vertically, which

11:01.210 --> 11:04.300
means all of these tax will be pushed down a little bit.

11:04.750 --> 11:05.500
This is not bad.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.450
So I'm going to go control Z.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.310
So we have that back.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.220
OK, so its final tests here?

11:12.550 --> 11:13.120
Very good.

11:13.420 --> 11:13.900
OK.

11:14.110 --> 11:14.920
So there you have it.

11:15.340 --> 11:20.470
It's working, and it's the end of our fun project here.

11:20.860 --> 11:23.370
Now again, I have to emphasize this is not the end.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.240
Obviously, this is just the beginning.

11:25.270 --> 11:25.750
In fact.

11:26.070 --> 11:32.580
I ran through this real quick and I did explain things, other things I did not, and it's all intentional

11:32.580 --> 11:36.000
because I didn't want to bug you down with the details.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.870
Too much details.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.310
This is just the beginning.

11:38.520 --> 11:43.050
We are going to dive through this like no one else coming lesson.

11:43.050 --> 11:43.410
So.

11:43.780 --> 11:49.290
So do not worry if none of this made sense, as long as you were able to go through and see what it

11:49.290 --> 11:53.550
was doing and kind of like, navigate in your mind what's going on a little bit.

11:53.550 --> 11:56.910
That's all that I'm hoping that you got from this.

11:57.510 --> 12:02.400
We will go through all of this into more detail than ever in the next videos.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.750
OK, congratulations if you were able to build this simple application.

12:07.080 --> 12:11.880
And I really look forward to seeing next what we're going to be diving deeper even deeper.

12:11.910 --> 12:17.370
Yes, it's possible even deeper into this amazing new tool that is compose.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.980
OK, thank you so much, and I'll see you next time.

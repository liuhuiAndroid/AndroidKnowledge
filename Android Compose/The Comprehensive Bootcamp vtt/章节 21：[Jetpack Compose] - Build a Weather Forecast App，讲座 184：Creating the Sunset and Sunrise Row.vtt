WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:01.620
All right, making good progress.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.670
Next, we're going to add this sunset and sunrise row there.

00:05.820 --> 00:10.030
Now I want you to pause the video and see if you can structure this.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.550
OK, go ahead and do that.

00:29.870 --> 00:30.200
All right.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.730
I hope you were able to do that.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.350
Let's do it.

00:34.520 --> 00:34.760
All right.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.400
It's always I'm going to put under here.

00:37.460 --> 00:38.370
Say Sunset.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.110
Sunset, sunrise.

00:43.880 --> 00:48.620
Ro, OK, I'm going to pass the same thing, the passed, which is the weather

00:51.380 --> 00:58.130
data and at least get that first one, that's totally fine and let's create it.

01:00.180 --> 01:00.460
OK.

01:00.650 --> 01:01.680
Let's talk about them there.

01:05.890 --> 01:06.550
All right.

01:06.670 --> 01:09.010
So, as you know, going to put together a row.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.290
And modifier

01:14.630 --> 01:18.080
Phil Max with this.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.000
And give it padding.

01:23.920 --> 01:33.240
I want top to be about 15 dpi and bottom to be about 60.

01:33.670 --> 01:36.100
OK, give that nice separation.

01:37.450 --> 01:41.630
And of course, inside we're going to create another couple of rows.

01:41.630 --> 01:44.230
So this first row and then the second row.

01:45.610 --> 01:54.940
So then to create an oval room and for now, the strongest possible image pasta painter paint a resource

01:55.810 --> 01:56.380
such

01:59.260 --> 02:01.450
travel and sunrise.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.700
We're going to get that sunrise first.

02:05.530 --> 02:06.700
Give it a modifier.

02:14.710 --> 02:20.690
Twenty five of size, right, and then price in a text.

02:32.930 --> 02:34.940
And for this text, amateur use format.

02:36.210 --> 02:37.740
Date time.

02:38.170 --> 02:38.580
Right.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.620
And then we're past the weather.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.360
It's Sunrise like this.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.900
Give it style.

03:04.230 --> 03:07.510
You know, topography and make it caption so small.

03:09.480 --> 03:09.840
All right.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.350
Let's.

03:12.590 --> 03:13.940
Copy this through.

03:21.490 --> 03:22.990
That's going to be sunset

03:25.900 --> 03:31.660
at sunset and sunset like this.

03:31.780 --> 03:33.340
So just changing a few things there.

03:34.000 --> 03:34.250
All right.

03:34.270 --> 03:36.040
Let's go ahead and run this to see.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.940
OK, that looks really good.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.900
Now, one thing I'm going to do, I'm going to reverse what is shown before sunset.

03:50.160 --> 03:56.430
Let's add alignment for this row the main row

03:58.710 --> 03:59.750
horizontal.

04:02.970 --> 04:03.900
Arrangement.

04:08.350 --> 04:12.280
Space in between its use of vertical alignment

04:14.620 --> 04:16.000
center, such.

04:18.150 --> 04:25.190
Well, so doing this allows us to separate them horizontally so that we have that middle space there.

04:25.240 --> 04:35.630
So it looks really nice if we wanted, we can make perhaps this little bit larger, maybe 30 or sunrise

04:35.640 --> 04:36.150
and.

04:38.890 --> 04:39.940
I like that much better.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.280
And throw for sunset as well.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.360
All right, so those are way better sites, and I like the way things look.

04:50.750 --> 04:54.560
OK, now you may ask, where is this format to date time coming from?

04:54.570 --> 05:01.850
Well, if we remember, we added, or at least I added here again, it's just a format function, so

05:01.850 --> 05:03.590
we pass and each timestamp.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.410
We then use simple data format to pass the pattern we want to see.

05:08.420 --> 05:14.240
So this is so you can see here one or nine a.m. 10:36 AM and so forth, right?

05:14.540 --> 05:17.660
So that is just a helper function, if you will.

05:19.540 --> 05:22.420
OK, so we are looking really good.

05:22.600 --> 05:27.250
It's starting to look really like what we have here, so it's it's very exciting.

05:27.250 --> 05:27.760
I like that.

05:28.630 --> 05:33.550
Next, I would like you to add this text that says this week and then maybe you can start.

05:33.970 --> 05:38.650
We're looking through and getting all of the forecast for this week, right?

05:38.680 --> 05:39.820
Seven day forecast.

05:40.150 --> 05:45.970
It's very easy because if you look at what we have, right, so have the list.

05:46.420 --> 05:53.020
Really, this list should have count of seven, which means seven days and look through as you look

05:53.020 --> 05:59.770
through, you create a row a row like this, which will have the date or actually actually the day.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.000
And then an image.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.140
We've created that image function or image composable.

06:05.470 --> 06:10.090
And then you have your description of that weather to date.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.340
OK, and then we have high and low.

06:13.180 --> 06:15.520
OK, so go ahead and try to figure out something like this.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.800
It's not that hard, especially in compose.

06:18.130 --> 06:24.430
The most important thing here is to understand that we have a row, as you see there, that will contain

06:24.430 --> 06:31.900
all of these items and of course, a nice a nice card circular card, as you see also there.

06:32.230 --> 06:36.280
If you want, you can clip as well, just like we have here and do all sort of thing.

06:36.290 --> 06:41.070
So go ahead and pause these video pauses lectures and see if we can figure that out.

06:41.070 --> 06:41.950
Do you have the data?

06:42.250 --> 06:46.600
You have the knowledge at this point, it should have at least a little bit of knowledge to do this.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.470
Go ahead and do that.

06:47.480 --> 06:53.040
And remember, you have a column, a lazy column that we can use to do this right.

06:53.050 --> 06:57.790
So please pause this video for a while and tackle this exercise.

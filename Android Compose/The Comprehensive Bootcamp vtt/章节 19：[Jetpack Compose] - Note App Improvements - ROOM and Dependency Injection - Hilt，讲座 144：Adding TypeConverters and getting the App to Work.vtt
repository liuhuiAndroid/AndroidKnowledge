WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:08.500
OK, so let's create a couple converters here, because remember in our note model, we have the date

00:08.680 --> 00:11.980
which will need a converter as well as the utility.

00:13.090 --> 00:16.480
Let's start by creating a new package.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.050
It's called Issue two for utilities utility.

00:20.050 --> 00:21.850
Such right in inside.

00:21.850 --> 00:24.720
Here we're going to create first first class here.

00:24.740 --> 00:25.660
Let's call this.

00:35.950 --> 00:41.110
Let's call this date converter or such.

00:41.530 --> 00:42.400
And there we go.

00:42.430 --> 00:43.660
So what are we going to do here?

00:43.690 --> 00:45.840
First, we're going to create two functions.

00:45.850 --> 00:49.240
The first one is going to be the time stamp from date.

00:49.250 --> 00:54.400
So we're going to convert from the date into something that isn't a date right in this case is going

00:54.400 --> 00:55.420
to be a long time.

00:56.010 --> 00:58.870
So put all of that for us.

00:59.080 --> 01:02.890
So first, I'm going to add this type converter

01:05.830 --> 01:06.430
as such.

01:06.740 --> 01:10.260
OK, and then create the function can name it, whatever we want.

01:10.270 --> 01:14.080
But these names that make sense are important.

01:14.090 --> 01:22.900
So from date, in this case, we're going to pass in a date time and I'm going to just return along

01:23.170 --> 01:26.060
because this is just going to be a time stamp, right?

01:27.100 --> 01:30.610
A Unix time stamp when it passed that they're OK.

01:31.150 --> 01:36.190
And what I'm going to return in this case, I'm just going to return this date that time.

01:37.210 --> 01:43.420
OK, so from time stamp into the actual data times, if you have over here, this is going to be the

01:43.420 --> 01:43.870
type.

01:43.990 --> 01:45.520
Let's go ahead and have it over.

01:46.830 --> 01:52.440
OK, there you go, and next one I'm going to create, it's going to be the same thing at type converter

01:52.590 --> 01:53.010
again.

01:54.630 --> 02:00.060
So it's going to be date time stamp like this.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.060
And what do we need to pass it this time stamp?

02:06.530 --> 02:10.130
Which is going to be a long time, and we're going to return a date.

02:10.280 --> 02:16.040
I'm going to make this Nullarbor like this and can say, return this case now and return the actual

02:16.040 --> 02:21.590
date and pass in the time stamp that we're passing to create actual date.

02:22.520 --> 02:22.790
Right?

02:23.830 --> 02:28.110
And going to create another one, we need for our you I.D..

02:32.120 --> 02:35.870
So you u i d converter.

02:42.580 --> 02:43.030
OK.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.220
Same thing at Thai composure.

02:48.880 --> 02:54.440
So the first function here say from you, you I.D..

02:59.260 --> 03:09.670
Right, and we're going to return a string to return you I.D. and passing to a string like this.

03:10.090 --> 03:10.390
OK.

03:13.570 --> 03:16.450
And the other one is going to convert the other way around.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.390
So again, at times converter.

03:24.950 --> 03:29.540
And you, I d from stringing

03:33.690 --> 03:37.180
like that, and we're going to return, of course, ID type.

03:39.560 --> 03:39.780
OK.

03:40.730 --> 03:41.450
Return.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.250
From String and Paso, a string like that.

03:49.130 --> 03:49.400
Right.

03:49.940 --> 03:57.080
So we have to do this now, how do we make it so that these converts are recognized when we create our

03:57.080 --> 04:03.320
table so that room will understand, OK, whenever we want, then to add something to this table or

04:03.320 --> 04:09.920
database, we are going to use this converters to convert those types so that we don't have issues that

04:09.920 --> 04:10.220
way.

04:10.230 --> 04:12.770
Room doesn't complain as it has been doing.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.550
What do we do now is we go to our database class.

04:16.970 --> 04:18.220
Remember that no database.

04:18.230 --> 04:22.580
So let's go ahead and get note database first one.

04:23.450 --> 04:26.270
Here we can pass those type converters.

04:26.790 --> 04:32.850
I forget so I can just go like they say at Typekit converters.

04:32.870 --> 04:39.560
So these will be passed along when the database is called to create itself.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.350
So I'm going to go ahead and say database.

04:43.820 --> 04:48.710
Well, actually, it is going to be a date converter say, class.

04:50.180 --> 04:57.770
And then when I pass you, you I d converter and it's, of course, a class type, oops, this has to

04:57.770 --> 04:59.690
be class lowercase like this.

05:01.540 --> 05:02.170
And that's it.

05:02.860 --> 05:10.000
So if you have any type that room doesn't know that exist or it doesn't know how to handle it, you

05:10.000 --> 05:18.340
will have to create those converter classes at such rate from one form to another and then you go to

05:18.340 --> 05:20.140
your database class.

05:20.140 --> 05:25.390
That he created in this case was an abstract class, and he just passed past there at Typekit voters

05:25.600 --> 05:28.450
and again passes many converters that you may need.

05:30.020 --> 05:30.470
That's it.

05:30.660 --> 05:35.540
Okay, let's go ahead, and hopefully this will solve our problems because we want to see some action,

05:35.570 --> 05:41.990
want to see things working, let's clean everything up first and let's go ahead and run once again.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.690
And fingers crossed, let's make sure this.

05:45.050 --> 05:46.700
Let's hope that this works.

05:48.560 --> 05:55.040
And yet we haven't had a problem, he says, here to use quality in features, you must add.

05:55.350 --> 06:00.890
Katie artifact from room al dependency so and road room talks like this?

06:01.370 --> 06:02.540
Right, right.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.260
This is again another revelation here.

06:06.260 --> 06:11.810
Ladies and gentlemen, this is good because we are learning that things don't always work as we want

06:11.810 --> 06:13.790
them, so I'm missing a few other things.

06:13.820 --> 06:18.690
That's the thing because we're using Caitlin and we want to use scuttling extensions here.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.030
We need to pass those as well.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.500
So what is that?

06:21.500 --> 06:22.220
I need to pass?

06:22.250 --> 06:23.060
Let's go.

06:24.030 --> 06:25.130
We have room.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.310
He says the Android X Room, Katy X.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.700
So I'm just going to put some here.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.480
There we go.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.550
This is what we need, so.

06:35.780 --> 06:37.760
All right, let's go ahead and sync.

06:41.150 --> 06:47.180
Now, the beauty, as you see it tells us, whenever there is a dependency lacking, the compiler will

06:47.180 --> 06:50.390
always gives us good hints for the most part.

06:50.630 --> 06:50.990
All right.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.580
Let's see.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.710
Let's go ahead and run.

06:55.910 --> 06:56.810
We're getting close.

06:58.970 --> 07:01.940
As you see here, the app is running out now.

07:02.210 --> 07:07.210
Let's see if this actually works, because that's actually what you know.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.270
What are we looking for here?

07:08.780 --> 07:09.710
Let's say hello.

07:12.090 --> 07:18.200
And in this ad, and voila, it's being added, I say new item.

07:20.160 --> 07:28.170
Next time and everything is working, let's see if we can delete by tapping tap and voila, it's done.

07:28.470 --> 07:34.020
Now I can get out of this app altogether and stop everything.

07:35.100 --> 07:40.740
The idea is that because we are persisting data using room, if we run this app again, we should at

07:40.740 --> 07:42.690
least see one item being loaded.

07:43.230 --> 07:49.290
And as you see, there it is that one item that is persisted was persisted and is looking really good

07:49.620 --> 07:49.950
now.

07:50.100 --> 07:56.010
The other thing you notice here is that we got rid of the time stamp, meaning we don't see the time

07:56.010 --> 07:59.100
there when this was added so we can go back to.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.130
I believe it's going to be our main.

08:02.130 --> 08:03.210
Let's get rid of all of these.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.940
We'll see that at the bottom because we are having these issues earlier.

08:08.970 --> 08:09.870
Yes, there we go.

08:10.410 --> 08:16.140
Now we can just go ahead and oncoming that we still have some problems because this formatting is not

08:16.140 --> 08:18.060
going to work because we've changed a few things.

08:18.570 --> 08:19.200
No problem.

08:19.650 --> 08:27.850
What do we need to do is because we need to get whatever we getting from our note to into date and get

08:27.850 --> 08:30.810
it formatted that will get us where we want to see.

08:31.650 --> 08:36.300
So for that, we are actually going to create instead of retail here, let's create another.

08:37.270 --> 08:39.310
Folder of another file.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.410
Just going to be a file, the say call this utils.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.580
And here we're going to create a function.

08:47.710 --> 08:53.240
I'm going to say fun and say format date.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.750
So what are we going to do is we're going to get the time.

08:56.890 --> 09:01.270
In this case, the time's going to come along because that's the time stamp.

09:01.420 --> 09:06.400
It comes as a long tape and they will want to get a string so formatted date.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.580
So I'm going to say foul, get the date right.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.500
So you can see date.

09:12.760 --> 09:19.570
And let's say this have date there, and then I'm going to pass our time.

09:19.750 --> 09:25.510
So this will convert this long time stamp into an actual date.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.080
OK.

09:26.560 --> 09:31.660
And then I'm going to use file format and then I'm going to invoke this simple.

09:33.070 --> 09:38.620
Date format from Java text, and then here I'm going to pass the pattern because the way because I want

09:38.620 --> 09:46.900
to because I want to instruct our formatter here what kind of or how am I going to show this date?

09:46.930 --> 09:50.710
So there's a lot of different ways to show a date when to use this one?

09:50.710 --> 09:51.310
Eat.

09:52.720 --> 10:00.230
A., D. M. and a h, h and M and then A's like this.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.800
So this is how I'm going to format our date.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.760
And then here I'm going to pass the locale also long say look.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.440
Could get to default.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.630
OK, so default of the application.

10:13.230 --> 10:13.650
All right.

10:13.710 --> 10:17.850
And then I'm going to return this case for format.

10:19.750 --> 10:26.920
Like this that format and then pass our date, it can pass, let's see.

10:27.770 --> 10:30.520
So now let me just get rid of all of this.

10:31.810 --> 10:38.710
Let's just say format date and pass out a note that entry date.

10:39.700 --> 10:45.520
And just to time like this to get to the actual time long, which is the type we need for out from my

10:45.520 --> 10:47.050
date and everything should be good.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.520
OK, let's go ahead and run now.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.910
We should start seeing the date.

10:53.980 --> 11:02.020
And there it is, Sunday in October at four to eight p.m., So if you add something else here, save,

11:02.020 --> 11:05.770
you can see now all of them have data attached to them.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.570
OK, very good.

11:08.290 --> 11:08.800
All right.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.300
So we did it.

11:10.480 --> 11:17.080
So we were able to put together an entire application, a note application that's very simple in nature,

11:17.080 --> 11:20.350
but we learned a lot at this point.

11:20.380 --> 11:25.630
One thing you can do is to make this even better in a sense that you can change the user interface,

11:25.900 --> 11:30.190
perhaps make the text a little bit better or add more functionality to it.

11:30.640 --> 11:35.380
Because you remember, in our note view model, we have, for instance, the update.

11:35.590 --> 11:42.010
How do you update a note so you can figure that out, maybe make it so that when this is long pressed,

11:42.460 --> 11:49.420
then we're going to take all of the information, like the title and description back to our fields

11:49.720 --> 11:51.670
and then change this save to.

11:52.560 --> 11:57.990
To update, right, so do users know that they can update and then the user will be able to update,

11:57.990 --> 12:04.050
of course, the title ending out and then the update and then of course, they can see the changes like

12:04.050 --> 12:04.220
that.

12:04.230 --> 12:09.120
So there's a lot of things you can do because now we have the infrastructure that's set up for us to

12:09.120 --> 12:10.170
do that.

12:10.550 --> 12:14.800
OK, so it was a long journey, and I hope you enjoyed it.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.350
I hope you've learned a lot.

12:16.740 --> 12:24.810
So and if there are things that are not really computing right now, it's OK to go back and rewatch

12:24.810 --> 12:33.540
these videos and maybe ask questions and really take the time to think and try to kind of study this,

12:34.050 --> 12:35.610
this section a little bit longer.

12:35.730 --> 12:42.150
We've talked about a lot of things, especially when it comes to how to structure your applications,

12:42.480 --> 12:46.200
as well as DIY or dependency injection using hilt.

12:46.950 --> 12:49.800
So take your time, and there's still a lot to learn.

12:49.830 --> 12:55.350
Of course, they couldn't put everything here in one section when it comes to health and so forth.

12:55.370 --> 12:56.940
But but it's a good start.

12:57.960 --> 13:03.390
One thing I would like you to think about or keep in mind, is that yes, it takes a little bit of work

13:03.390 --> 13:10.050
to set up health and make sure that everything is good and put together that structure we talked about

13:10.470 --> 13:12.590
for our room database.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.890
But it's worth it.

13:14.160 --> 13:22.140
As you see now, it's way easier for us to extend this app to do all sorts of things to make this app

13:22.140 --> 13:29.550
as complex as we possibly can make it because we have that base infrastructure set up correctly.

13:30.150 --> 13:36.630
So think about that takes a little bit of work for it to set it up, but it's worth it, and you should

13:36.630 --> 13:39.000
always opt to do this way.

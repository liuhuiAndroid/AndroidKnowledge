00:00.150 --> 00:05.550
All right, so we've made a lot of progress from the beginning, we started with my screen and we did

00:05.760 --> 00:11.790
the lock and screens and and of course, we went ahead and put together this awesome main screen, our

00:11.790 --> 00:13.020
home screen, as we call it.

00:13.230 --> 00:17.370
And there are a lot of things that we had to put together, but it was fun and we are very happy at

00:17.370 --> 00:17.760
this point.

00:17.790 --> 00:22.890
I hope you are following along and your coding and you're getting a little bit of frustrated but fixing

00:22.890 --> 00:27.390
things, and that's part of the whole thing about learning programming.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.250
There's really no other way around it.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.950
But I hope is that too painful and shouldn't be?

00:31.950 --> 00:33.330
That's not the idea, really.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.130
OK, so we've done that.

00:35.130 --> 00:42.300
And then, of course, we just finished the search books screen here, which allows us to we, you know,

00:42.300 --> 00:50.760
to go into our API, Google's book API and get information and then load it all up here so we can now

00:50.760 --> 00:57.600
search for books, any topic we want and we can get some books, which is really exciting and we'll

00:57.600 --> 00:58.970
learn a lot along the way.

00:58.980 --> 01:06.510
Of course, we'll learn how to use Retrofit, which is the HP client library used in Java and codling,

01:06.510 --> 01:08.310
of course, and Android development.

01:08.620 --> 01:14.070
OK, so we've now finished with our search books for the most part, meaning the user interface is going

01:14.070 --> 01:14.870
to be just like that.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.290
We can improve upon it, of course.

01:16.650 --> 01:20.040
I encourage you to do so, but the base is there.

01:20.580 --> 01:26.670
And so in the next lectures, in the next sections, what are we going to do is we're going to look

01:26.670 --> 01:31.980
at the detailed screen because now we're going to take the user when they click on, for instance,

01:31.980 --> 01:37.020
Android for Dummies book, we want to show them, for instance, a little bit more information about

01:37.020 --> 01:37.560
that book.

01:37.830 --> 01:44.700
It could be the description and also a way for users to be able to save that book, right?

01:44.730 --> 01:50.580
So when they save the book, we're going to save that to our backend Firestar database and then later

01:50.580 --> 01:55.200
we can retrieve back in our main screen here homescreen.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.910
All right, I'll see you next.

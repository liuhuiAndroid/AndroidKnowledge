In programming, a function is a set of instructions bundle together to achieve a certain outcome superior

00:06.180 --> 00:12.630
is to put together a structure where we can add the statements, we can add logic, we can add everything

00:12.630 --> 00:19.990
we need to create a basic unit of a program per se to achieve certain result, to have a certain outcome.

00:20.010 --> 00:21.690
So we've seen function before.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.660
This is a function fun that stands for functions of fun.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.880
In this case, will be the key word used in codling to create a function to start the functions they

00:29.880 --> 00:31.680
find and then the name of the function.

00:31.950 --> 00:35.860
And then we have their parentheses and of course, the body, right?

00:36.120 --> 00:39.930
The part of the function is enclosed in a set of curly braces.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.530
Then we call actually another function, right?

00:42.570 --> 00:46.020
This is given by the Scotland Library called print.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.370
And then we say Hello world.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.770
So that is indeed a function figure here.

00:50.010 --> 00:50.670
Still the same.

00:51.030 --> 00:57.090
So we enclosing certain logic in this case, we just have one statement there, which is a print function

00:57.090 --> 01:01.110
called And we're passing Hello World, but we can have multiple things inside there.

01:01.410 --> 01:05.250
The idea is the function of always contain certain logic.

01:05.610 --> 01:05.900
Right?

01:05.910 --> 01:09.480
It's going to bundle up that logic in one entity, if you will.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.530
Let's go back to our code and starting to put together these functions.

WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:09.210
So we need to create another table one entity so that we can hold the settings in this case, hold the

00:09.220 --> 00:14.160
measurement, I should say, of winter weather, his imperial or metric.

00:15.060 --> 00:19.140
So let's go back to a project and inside of.

00:20.810 --> 00:29.180
Our models here, I'm going to create yet another class cutting class that's going to be just a data

00:29.720 --> 00:30.200
class.

00:31.130 --> 00:36.230
Let's call this unit OK because it's going to be presenting a unit of measurement.

00:38.720 --> 00:46.850
OK, so I'm going to make sure this is an entity, so same thing we did with favourite and table name.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.740
Called Settings Tbo.

00:55.210 --> 00:55.610
All right.

00:55.740 --> 01:01.080
So I'm going to start by saying, I know or not novel should say no, no.

01:02.790 --> 01:09.690
And this is going to be at the primary key as well, and I'm going to make Stacey that column in full

01:10.290 --> 01:10.950
the name.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.110
It's going to be unit.

01:13.380 --> 01:21.530
So we're just going to have one column or one in this case, variable or Property Valley Unit.

01:21.660 --> 01:22.950
It's going to just be a string.

01:23.790 --> 01:24.450
Very simple.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.470
Again, we could have done this using a simpler data structure that allows us to save pieces of data.

01:31.710 --> 01:37.920
But because we are looking into a database and that's just fine, we can just use the database, right?

01:38.010 --> 01:38.460
That's it.

01:38.550 --> 01:41.160
Now, because we created this entity, a table.

01:41.430 --> 01:44.760
You remember, we need to go back and get rid of all of this.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.130
We need to go back to our database, a weather database.

01:54.600 --> 01:54.870
Right.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.750
Because remember, this is the skeleton that's created for our database, and we need to add that class

02:01.740 --> 02:04.410
or rather that entity, right?

02:04.980 --> 02:06.150
Which is a class, of course.

02:06.450 --> 02:09.270
So I'm going to say unity or unity.

02:10.320 --> 02:16.380
Make sure again, this is another thing about naming make sure that we get our unit, not the coddling

02:16.380 --> 02:16.690
unit.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.500
This is our model class unit.

02:20.070 --> 02:20.400
OK.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.310
And make sure that's a class like this.

02:23.580 --> 02:30.990
Now, before we do anything else, what's going to happen because we've changed the skeleton structure

02:31.980 --> 02:34.350
of our database room extension here?

02:35.400 --> 02:37.400
We will have to change a few things.

02:37.410 --> 02:42.120
While one thing really, we're going to change the version that way when this database, because we'll

02:42.120 --> 02:44.610
have to recompiled and recreate it in the background.

02:45.120 --> 02:50.730
We are going to override everything and create this unit class along the way as well.

02:51.090 --> 02:55.260
So changed us to a higher number than we had before.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.660
If you had five, then change that to six.

02:58.860 --> 02:59.160
OK.

02:59.670 --> 03:00.060
Very good.

03:00.690 --> 03:08.190
So now that we have this table unit table that we created here, entity, we need to go do the same

03:08.190 --> 03:10.860
thing we did with our favorite, which is we need to create.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.290
We need to add into our Dow and into our repository.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.180
OK, let's go back to.

03:22.660 --> 03:31.990
And here we created all of these right crud operations and so forth for our favorites, so now I'm going

03:31.990 --> 03:37.240
to create the same thing for our unit table per se.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.380
So it's going to be pretty much the same.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.190
I accept a few changes there.

03:47.850 --> 03:55.920
So let's copy this, and I'm going to do just a few that we're going to be using because the concept

03:55.920 --> 03:57.660
is the same and you can always do it yourself.

03:58.020 --> 04:02.010
So for this one is going to be, I think, settings table.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.730
They would go and instead of get favorites, this is going to be get.

04:08.460 --> 04:18.610
Units, this flow list of units, objects, again, make sure we don't get the in, we get our unit

04:18.610 --> 04:22.330
here, so you can see that is our model class.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.040
That's very important.

04:27.540 --> 04:35.880
And then I'm just going to copy and added here again, because it's very the same thing, really.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.520
And.

04:46.250 --> 04:50.570
And it's not, you know, Caitlin is going to be unit again.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.030
Be very careful, we get the correct unit.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.370
While I'm here, let's just get everything, really, that's fine.

05:02.950 --> 05:06.370
Again, make sure not to coddling units, our unit.

05:07.510 --> 05:10.480
That's what happened when you and copy and paste.

05:11.570 --> 05:16.550
OK, so insert unit data unit, get units, let's get delete.

05:18.020 --> 05:18.860
All units.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.200
OK, that's very simple.

05:28.390 --> 05:32.200
And if we want to delete one unit, we can do so as well.

05:32.510 --> 05:36.430
OK, I think that's enough for us.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.310
It's going to be units, our type units like this.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.310
OK, so we add Vladimir, whether weather now.

05:42.490 --> 05:42.970
Very good.

05:43.840 --> 05:54.040
Now we need to go to our repository where the repository, whether DB repository that is.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.070
And what I'm going to do here.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.880
I just larger for now and say we're not running anything.

06:11.110 --> 06:13.480
I'm going to copy and get the other ones.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.260
There we go.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.080
I need to change because I'm copying and pasting.

06:45.350 --> 06:48.590
I'm sure you get the right unit, right?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.250
I see.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.940
We're not going to use that update, right?

06:51.950 --> 06:52.880
That's OK.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.310
Can you do that in a way?

06:55.850 --> 06:56.600
And the unit?

07:05.130 --> 07:07.020
OK, delete all units.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.800
It or anything like that?

07:17.820 --> 07:19.050
OK, that's fine.

07:19.950 --> 07:23.940
Again, I'm copying and pasting, you're not explaining much because if you have been following us,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.410
this is not, you know, something new.

07:27.420 --> 07:33.840
We've done this before and you can just go back to the previous videos if you are not remembering what

07:33.840 --> 07:34.200
it was doing.

07:34.590 --> 07:37.590
Next thing we need to create a Settings review model, right?

07:37.980 --> 07:41.610
So you can do in class

07:44.040 --> 07:46.530
settings, do you model?

07:47.130 --> 07:51.300
So again, it's going to be exactly the same as favorite settings, right?

07:51.480 --> 08:01.530
Or if you moderately should say, I'm sure this units are actually all units first or unit.

08:04.200 --> 08:04.610
OK.

08:06.530 --> 08:07.970
Sometimes the.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.770
OK, that's fine if he wants to do that.

08:14.030 --> 08:17.640
I'm just going to add all those units that way.

08:17.700 --> 08:22.260
We don't run into issues in this quarantine here.

08:22.650 --> 08:27.420
It's sort of a repository, not get units.

08:31.020 --> 08:33.000
Extinct until changed.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.760
Collect there we go now.

08:42.780 --> 08:43.470
It's showing.

08:43.500 --> 08:48.180
All right, so now I'm going to just get all of that code so we don't have to.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.220
Go through the same thing.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.170
At least four units.

09:14.080 --> 09:21.010
And make sure, yes, this unit here again is probably getting she should have probably named something

09:21.010 --> 09:23.750
differently, something different instead of a unit.

09:24.010 --> 09:24.370
OK.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.830
It has changed our unit and life should be good.

09:27.880 --> 09:31.480
It looks like now I don't have to pass all of that redundant junk.

09:32.170 --> 09:32.500
All right.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.020
So just a few things that we have to change here and there.

09:35.020 --> 09:40.240
But again, as you see here, really, I don't need to explain everything again because everything is

09:40.240 --> 09:47.560
looking the same because everything is the same thing that we did with our favorite repository.

09:47.890 --> 09:49.660
OK, so we're just mirroring the same thing.

09:52.990 --> 09:53.380
All right.

09:53.950 --> 09:57.010
So in this case, now we go to a settings screen

10:01.060 --> 10:07.540
and instead of just passing the controller now we can also pass our Settings View model.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.610
And I'm going to say it's going to be a Hilt V model such.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.820
And let's make this a scaffold.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.380
A top bar.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.170
OK.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.350
All right, so we've created our Settings View model and part of our Settings screen.

10:35.560 --> 10:35.910
All right.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.970
So we'll come back to that.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.640
This feed is getting a little bit too long, but there we go.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.810
So at this point, let's go ahead and run.

10:41.840 --> 10:46.690
Of course, we are going to see really anything new, but we want to make sure that nothing breaks,

10:46.690 --> 10:48.100
because that's that's very important.

10:48.730 --> 10:54.670
And the next video we are going to tackle the settings screen so that hopefully it looks something like

10:54.670 --> 10:54.970
this.

10:55.240 --> 10:55.930
It's very simple.

10:55.930 --> 10:56.620
We can do that.

10:57.310 --> 10:58.390
Let's run first.

11:05.580 --> 11:08.940
OK, so everything's still looking good.

11:10.830 --> 11:11.470
All right.

11:11.490 --> 11:16.680
You can see now because we griped because we wiped out the database.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.740
Now we don't have anything in our favorites, which is fine.

11:20.190 --> 11:21.630
We just testing things around anyway.

11:21.870 --> 11:23.170
So now we can save again.

11:23.190 --> 11:29.850
San Diego added to favorites go to favorites, should see San Diego, click on San Diego, get San Diego

11:29.850 --> 11:30.120
again.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.170
All right, so very good.

11:32.010 --> 11:32.760
Nothing broke.

11:33.660 --> 11:39.540
The database just went and wiped itself out because we changed the versioning to say that we added something

11:39.540 --> 11:39.810
new.

11:39.810 --> 11:40.290
That's fine.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.930
Forget everything is good.

11:41.940 --> 11:48.300
So we were ready then to look at the settings screen to make it so that it looks like this, and then

11:48.300 --> 11:54.210
we can save the settings so we can change the the measurement right of measurements.

11:54.390 --> 11:56.160
Celsius or Fahrenheit.

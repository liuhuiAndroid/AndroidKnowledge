WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.760
This is how the start screen will look like.

00:03.270 --> 00:04.530
OK, let's go ahead and start building it.

00:04.650 --> 00:05.370
It's got to be fun.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.520
The last part of the app they're going to be building.

00:08.670 --> 00:12.090
So until we are done with this application, so this is really good.

00:12.210 --> 00:12.690
Exciting.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.450
OK, let's go ahead and get started.

00:14.490 --> 00:21.870
Ladies and gentlemen, let's take care of the navigation so we know that we need to go to the start

00:21.880 --> 00:22.800
screen as such.

00:22.980 --> 00:31.500
But we also know that we will need the home view model such sunglasses equal to hilt the model and make

00:31.500 --> 00:33.330
sure that I pass here.

00:33.660 --> 00:38.730
Home Screen View model like this and I'm going to pass it along.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.470
Zongzi View model.

00:41.220 --> 00:43.920
Set that to home view model.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.040
We will have to create that parameter.

00:47.890 --> 00:51.910
So, OK, let's go to the screen and voila.

00:51.930 --> 00:59.160
Now that is added there so far, that screen has this not very helpful, but we will construct everything

00:59.160 --> 00:59.670
that we need.

00:59.970 --> 01:01.680
So, you know, read our home screen here.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.720
I'm going to say hilt with your model.

01:04.440 --> 01:08.970
So we have access to our model and get rid of all of this.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.100
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to first create a variable, say books.

01:15.510 --> 01:20.730
It's going to be a list of M book types.

01:21.210 --> 01:32.580
And then when I say current user, when I say Firebase, I get an instance when I get current user research

01:32.880 --> 01:36.870
because I'm going to use that and then let's go ahead and create a scaffold.

01:37.350 --> 01:39.360
And that's always a top bar.

01:40.470 --> 01:44.490
Put together the skeleton and then inside here, this is where we're going to add the body.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.770
So I'm going to put it surface and so forth.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.480
OK, let's start with the top bar.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.460
So we're going to do the same thing we did before.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.520
So we're going to have this nice top bar.

01:53.940 --> 02:02.100
So we already created that so I can just go ahead and call the reader app bar and the title.

02:02.130 --> 02:04.860
I'm going to say book stats.

02:08.320 --> 02:20.230
And then I'm going to pass icon icons, default arrow back and say, show profile, it's going to be

02:20.230 --> 02:20.950
false.

02:22.470 --> 02:25.320
And then controller, we pass our NAF controller.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.070
OK, that was easy.

02:29.790 --> 02:33.030
Now, you know, a surface here we get a structure, our code.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.110
Now what is I want to do here?

02:35.130 --> 02:43.650
Well, first of all, we only want to show books by this user that have been read.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.210
That makes sense.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.120
How do you do that?

02:46.140 --> 02:51.680
Well, in our books that we created lists, they're going to set that to put an if statement here.

02:51.690 --> 03:04.580
I would say if view model data that value you like and then get the data is null or empty.

03:04.590 --> 03:10.260
So in this case, if that's not the case because we have the exclamation point there, then we're good

03:10.260 --> 03:10.590
to go.

03:11.870 --> 03:15.650
That means that in I view model data that value

03:19.130 --> 03:26.230
get the data, we're going to go ahead and filter again through this book.

03:28.760 --> 03:28.970
OK.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.570
And I'm going to say an ebook

03:35.630 --> 03:41.710
user I.D. has to be equal to current user that you are Heidi.

03:42.180 --> 03:42.500
All right.

03:43.010 --> 03:48.350
So just get the books that have the same I.D. as this current user.

03:48.950 --> 03:54.980
Else, let's change that to VAR because I think it said that VAR because we're changing it.

03:55.730 --> 04:02.690
Well, else I'm going to just call an empty list to this box because we have no books by this user.

04:03.930 --> 04:04.230
OK.

04:05.060 --> 04:13.020
Bottom here, the column, and I'm going to add a row at a box the size of the entire box and then say

04:13.020 --> 04:19.710
45 deep and then padding about to dip all around.

04:19.960 --> 04:28.460
I'm just going to add a fun icon that say icons to icons dot sharp person.

04:30.060 --> 04:30.270
OK.

04:30.750 --> 04:35.190
This has to be image factor, which I say I can't for description.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.120
That's it.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.180
And then I on the side, I'm going to add a text.

04:40.140 --> 04:47.070
They will say hi, and then I'm going to use the user and say, current user.

04:49.020 --> 04:56.580
I'm going to get email this current user to strain and then will split because I just want to get the

04:56.580 --> 04:57.660
first part right?

04:59.070 --> 04:59.970
Split by.

05:01.270 --> 05:08.440
The ad dilemma there and get the first part of the email, so again, what I'm doing here.

05:09.010 --> 05:18.340
If email is like me or Paul, that at me dot com when split by Digg, like this, right?

05:18.350 --> 05:21.100
So now we have Paul and me dot com, so I'm going to get Paul.

05:21.610 --> 05:22.450
That's what I'm doing there.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.020
That's all.

05:23.650 --> 05:28.840
And I'm going to make this to uppercase like that.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.500
Oops, looks like doesn't like that.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.750
Let's see what is the other option.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.090
That works.

05:37.600 --> 05:43.420
OK, let's go ahead and run this real quick so we can see what we have so far.

05:43.510 --> 05:49.180
So we should have at least this structure and hi the name of the current user.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.140
OK, so let's click here.

05:52.810 --> 05:53.280
Angela.

05:53.550 --> 05:54.890
Say, hi, Jay.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.560
But again, next, we're going to go ahead and create a structure here.

05:58.980 --> 06:05.250
So after a row, I'm going to say card will.

06:06.960 --> 06:11.430
Qualifier Phil Max with.

06:13.470 --> 06:14.340
Give it padding.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.530
About four deep

06:19.290 --> 06:26.500
and outer circle or shape that is circle shape.

06:26.830 --> 06:38.430
Give an elevation of about five deep and I'm going to create a vowel called reader or read a book,

06:40.200 --> 06:41.370
read books list.

06:43.200 --> 06:49.470
It's going to be a list of banned books such just grading variable to hold something, and what's going

06:49.470 --> 06:51.180
to hold them are put inside of a if statement.

06:52.290 --> 06:59.430
So if you model getting the actual list of books is null or empty, in this case, it's not an all or

06:59.430 --> 06:59.820
empty.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.120
Then here I'm going to go ahead and filter some say books.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.570
That filter like this and an ebook,

07:12.020 --> 07:22.370
and I'm going to say an ebook check, our user ID is equal to the current again user user, you ID like

07:22.370 --> 07:22.700
that.

07:23.540 --> 07:31.820
And I want to make sure that also our book here finished reading is not novel.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.070
It's very important because that's what we need.

07:34.080 --> 07:41.240
So saying for our list with book lists here, we're going to look look through all the books that we

07:41.240 --> 07:41.720
have.

07:42.700 --> 07:49.270
At the top here is getting all the books, and we're going to filter through to check if it's if the

07:49.270 --> 07:52.450
book user I.D. is the same as the current newsworthy.

07:53.970 --> 07:58.380
And then if that's the case, then we're going to get that book or those books and add it to our read

07:58.380 --> 07:59.070
books list.

07:59.310 --> 08:07.410
And then I'm going to say else just pass an empty list to our book list.

08:08.910 --> 08:17.280
So just like what we did before variable here, reading books is going to be equal to books that filter

08:17.700 --> 08:18.190
again.

08:18.210 --> 08:24.300
So now I'm going to look for books that this user is reading at this point, so I'm going to filter

08:24.300 --> 08:25.350
again in the same book.

08:28.350 --> 08:33.030
I'm going to check if the book started reading.

08:33.690 --> 08:35.730
Not, no.

08:37.560 --> 08:43.410
And book that finished reading is not.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.600
So, which is one of the books that they were reading right now, so they haven't finished reading,

08:47.610 --> 08:47.880
right?

08:48.270 --> 08:49.110
That's what I want.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.580
Let's move that.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.590
So to have all insight like this?

08:53.170 --> 08:53.400
Right.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.290
So now it will have these reading books.

08:57.910 --> 09:05.080
I can use that to show essentially what I'm doing is I'm setting myself up so I can have this stats

09:05.080 --> 09:09.900
and then I can see you're reading showed the books they're reading, you've read the books I've read.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.230
That's all what I'm doing here.

09:12.130 --> 09:12.430
All right.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.810
So let's create a column.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.450
So now I'm going to create this structure here.

09:17.170 --> 09:22.180
Write this column so we can say starts in the text modifier.

09:26.260 --> 09:26.970
Padding.

09:28.230 --> 09:32.340
I say start bottom for deep

09:36.690 --> 09:39.180
and say horizontal alignment.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.760
I want this to be start.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.360
And that should be good.

09:46.020 --> 09:56.760
So I'm going to add a text inside here that would say your stats style, say material theme.

09:58.710 --> 09:59.580
Topography.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.120
It's five.

10:04.530 --> 10:05.970
Then I'm going to put a divider.

10:07.110 --> 10:10.710
Essentially, again, I'm doing this, I'm going to add this divider there.

10:13.670 --> 10:17.870
Banning an ad in a text, I will say.

10:20.840 --> 10:21.760
You are reading.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.880
Now, how do I get the numbers of books that I'm reading?

10:28.120 --> 10:30.670
Well, I already have this winning books.

10:30.790 --> 10:34.510
It's going to be a list so I can just get the size of that list, right?

10:35.440 --> 10:46.600
So reading books that size like this books and do the same.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.330
For the you've read books.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.320
Right, Booklist, that's right.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.240
Let's go ahead and run and see.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.480
OK, let's see.

11:02.930 --> 11:07.790
Click while you're right, you're reading two books, you've read one book.

11:08.150 --> 11:11.580
It's true if you go back, we don't have the go back yet.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.190
So it's click right how a reader app.

11:14.210 --> 11:16.820
Here we have elaborated.

11:16.840 --> 11:22.190
I can say enough controller that pop back stack English should be OK.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.170
Click OK.

11:25.560 --> 11:30.450
Two books that you were reading, if you go back and read, can see you have a list of two books there.

11:31.110 --> 11:34.950
I think that's good and I you've read one book so far.

11:35.930 --> 11:41.240
OK, so next, what are we going to do is just finalize and add the list of the books that we've read.

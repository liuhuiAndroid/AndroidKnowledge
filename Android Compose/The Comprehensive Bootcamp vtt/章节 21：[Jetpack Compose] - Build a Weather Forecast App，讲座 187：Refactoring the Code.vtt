00:00.840 --> 00:06.060
So as things are right now, all is working fine, and we're very happy, made a lot of progress.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.400
But let's go ahead and refactor a few things here because in main screen, you see we have a lot of

00:11.400 --> 00:18.480
different composable that probably there will be OK, of course, with all of them pertain to this composable

00:18.480 --> 00:21.590
main screen, but we can refactor some of them.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.100
In fact, probably all of them.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.750
Remove them from here to somewhere else.

00:28.170 --> 00:29.340
OK, so what I'm going to do?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.960
Let me get all of that from whether and in fact, let's see.

00:36.530 --> 00:41.570
Right from weather row all the way down again, we could have left all of them here, that's totally

00:41.570 --> 00:44.270
fine, but let's just get rid of them.

00:45.590 --> 00:46.790
Add them somewhere else.

00:50.290 --> 00:55.180
So I'm going to cut all of that and we're going to go to.

01:00.150 --> 01:00.750
Widgets.

01:02.670 --> 01:09.330
Create a new codling class is to file call this.

01:16.650 --> 01:21.270
Widgets and pace it all in there.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.240
OK, so back to Main.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.870
Now, all I have to do is.

01:34.830 --> 01:35.400
Import.

01:45.500 --> 01:45.890
OK.

01:46.280 --> 01:46.820
Port.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.010
All right.

01:53.540 --> 01:57.200
All right, let's make sure everything is correct.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.190
You can just fold a few of these.

02:01.050 --> 02:02.910
For that, that's good.

02:03.000 --> 02:03.870
Let's go ahead and run.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.250
Just make sure we didn't break anything.

02:08.130 --> 02:08.430
OK.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.550
Everything still works wonderful.

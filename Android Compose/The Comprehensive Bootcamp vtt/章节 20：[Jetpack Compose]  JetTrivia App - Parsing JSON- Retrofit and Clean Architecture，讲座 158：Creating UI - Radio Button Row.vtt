WEBVTT

00:01.590 --> 00:06.600
So now let's go ahead and put together this structure here, so we have at the top here where the question

00:06.600 --> 00:11.730
will be, and then we have these radio buttons here, but these radio buttons are going to be up to

00:11.730 --> 00:12.510
four of them.

00:12.510 --> 00:16.830
So we are going to dynamically create them as the questions come in.

00:17.490 --> 00:17.730
All right.

00:17.730 --> 00:23.910
So right after our dotted line, we're going to put a column here and it's of this column.

00:24.060 --> 00:32.130
I'm first going to add a text to this text is going to be, for instance, our tax here.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.870
We're going to add something like.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.870
What's the meaning of all this?

00:43.650 --> 00:43.890
OK.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.580
A little bit too philosophical, but it's OK.

00:48.090 --> 00:55.440
All right, so let's go ahead and make it or add some sort of style, let's say font size.

00:55.470 --> 01:05.130
At this point, I want to be about 17 XP and font weight.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.780
One needs to be bold.

01:10.590 --> 01:15.870
And line height, this tax, I'm going to be 22, that speed like that, OK?

01:16.440 --> 01:19.890
So that is something that would look like.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.590
There is let's see, right there we go.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.910
Looks like that, not exactly what the color is off.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.640
That means you have to change the color.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.380
So I'm going to say color.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.760
Collars and off white like this.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.260
OK, that looks really nice.

01:46.460 --> 01:53.420
And of course, we know that the immediate argument we can pass here is a modifier, so we're going

01:53.420 --> 01:55.670
to pass a modifier.

02:02.020 --> 02:10.840
I'm going to have padding of about 60 60p and then alignment, I want to align this text.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.640
I'm going to pass alignment.

02:14.040 --> 02:25.410
I say alignment as such alignment, Android X when I say start, so I want this to say start from the

02:25.410 --> 02:36.510
right, that's good and I want Phil Max height, but I don't want this to be all bad, but we don't

02:36.510 --> 02:40.080
want this text to take up the entire space we have here.

02:40.530 --> 02:46.710
So the great thing about if you look at Phil Max height of Phil Max with if you have an over, you will

02:46.710 --> 02:49.320
see that we can pass the fraction float here.

02:49.770 --> 02:55.770
This is really great because if you look at params, his fraction is the fraction of the maximum high

02:55.770 --> 02:58.110
to use between zero and one inclusive.

02:58.500 --> 03:05.610
That means if I pass something like this, I want this p zero point three fraction of the entire height,

03:06.070 --> 03:06.300
right?

03:06.780 --> 03:12.250
What we're really doing here is that we want about 30 percent of the height of the entire screen, right?

03:12.960 --> 03:16.830
When we say field max height, so this is what we are going to have.

03:17.130 --> 03:23.010
This is the space we're going to allow for the question text because remember this question?

03:23.010 --> 03:26.670
Text here could be very well, very small.

03:27.150 --> 03:28.380
That's going refresh again.

03:29.100 --> 03:29.430
Thanks.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.680
You can see the question could be very small.

03:31.710 --> 03:36.510
Not a lot of well, actually, this has a lot of text and others are very small.

03:36.510 --> 03:39.310
Like this first one here, so we won't accommodate that.

03:39.310 --> 03:47.730
I want to make sure that if indeed the question has a lot of text than we are, we were able then to

03:47.730 --> 03:48.780
accommodate that as well.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.530
So right, immediate to that, that means we have our text.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.200
Then we're going to have this space for the text.

03:55.740 --> 03:58.560
Depending on how large the tax is, it's going to be accommodated.

03:59.190 --> 04:03.300
But right after that, we're going to have the section where we're going to have these radio buttons.

04:03.810 --> 04:10.410
Like I said before, the concept here is different in that we are not going to hard code the answers

04:10.410 --> 04:13.470
or in this case, the amount of buttons or radio buttons.

04:13.920 --> 04:20.910
Because if you look at the answers the most they can have, the choices I should say, most we can have

04:20.910 --> 04:21.530
or for.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.760
But in case they will have false or true, we have just two choices, right?

04:27.390 --> 04:34.620
So what we what do we need to do is for each question as we receive it, we want to try this radio button

04:34.920 --> 04:36.120
on the fly to navigate.

04:36.570 --> 04:41.150
So if it goes and gets this one, this question, for instance, this object is going to go ahead and

04:41.150 --> 04:42.660
say, OK, choices is just two.

04:42.870 --> 04:46.350
So we're going to draw, as you see here, only two of these buttons.

04:47.070 --> 04:52.140
If, on the other hand, we have a question such as this and they have four choices, then we have to

04:52.140 --> 04:53.280
draw four choices.

04:53.700 --> 04:59.640
Also adding all of these choices there after a text here, I'm going to say choices.

05:00.030 --> 05:07.170
We have to look through the choices, array or list and get the number and then draw.

05:08.170 --> 05:11.260
The correct number of choices we have.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.080
So what do we need to do in our question?

05:13.120 --> 05:15.280
I display here, we need to pass a few parameters.

05:15.790 --> 05:22.720
First, one is going to be the question items going to say question item such that we're going to have

05:22.720 --> 05:25.500
some issues here with our preview.

05:25.510 --> 05:26.110
No problem.

05:26.290 --> 05:28.120
I'm going just to get rid of that for now.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.910
And then I'm going to pass here a question.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.710
Let's go ahead and import to that.

05:32.800 --> 05:39.550
Of course, the question item and then I'm going to pass here Question Index, which we will look at

05:39.790 --> 05:40.330
in a bit.

05:40.330 --> 05:41.080
So question.

05:41.890 --> 05:42.520
Index.

05:43.330 --> 05:44.560
It's going to be mutable.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.030
State passive int type.

05:48.520 --> 05:48.820
OK.

05:49.360 --> 05:53.050
And then of course, we're going to pass the view model, which is going to be a question for your model.

05:53.410 --> 06:01.360
And then we're going to have the honor next clicked because we wanted to be able to see that, OK,

06:01.360 --> 06:02.970
when this is clicked, we're in a pass.

06:03.030 --> 06:07.930
The value of the question that was was just clicked.

06:08.590 --> 06:13.380
So in this case, here, we're going to be passing the actual question item when we hit this question

06:13.390 --> 06:19.390
display because we want to be able to get that question, which is going to be this object, which is

06:19.390 --> 06:23.020
going to have question answer and the choices.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.310
So we have that object.

06:24.310 --> 06:30.520
So now we have to go and look through these choices so that we can decide what to draw on the screen,

06:30.520 --> 06:30.820
right?

06:31.030 --> 06:33.370
Two or four rate of buttons.

06:33.670 --> 06:39.220
So the question here is what drives everything, which means then we need some sort of state because

06:39.220 --> 06:45.970
remember, if I want to be able to dynamically draw those choices, I need to have some sort of state

06:45.970 --> 06:49.570
to draw these screen whenever it needs to be tried.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.650
Meaning if there's two, then we are going to try to, if there's four going to draw four.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.440
So that just tells us we need some sort of state.

06:56.890 --> 06:57.760
So right here.

06:58.330 --> 07:03.910
Choices say choices such state.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.720
That's fine.

07:05.230 --> 07:09.640
I'm going to use the remember because we need to be trying something.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.270
So remember will allow the recomposition really.

07:13.570 --> 07:19.440
And when say a question actually for our choices state here, I need to pass a value to compute, which

07:19.480 --> 07:24.460
is going to be our question object that we're going to be passing this question item there, right?

07:25.180 --> 07:31.000
So inside here and when to say question item in this case, guide choices, choices as such.

07:31.450 --> 07:37.990
And I'm going to say to mutable list because remember, this is indeed a list we want to make it a mutable

07:37.990 --> 07:38.410
list.

07:39.630 --> 07:44.280
So we can work with very good, so now that we have this choice choices state, we can look through

07:44.280 --> 07:51.050
it, which means right here, I'm going to say it's follow, I'm going to say choices, choices state

07:51.060 --> 07:59.880
at such the for each and I want the for each index because I need the index for each item that I'm getting.

08:00.330 --> 08:01.350
We'll see later why.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.390
So I have the index and then I have the actual item.

08:04.410 --> 08:08.760
So I'm going to say answer text can call whatever you want, but that works.

08:09.600 --> 08:15.510
And then here is where I'm going to create a row in this case and will create this row for these buttons

08:15.510 --> 08:15.780
here.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.520
So let's pass a modifier.

08:22.000 --> 08:31.540
Padding modifier that padding about three deep and then once they fill Max with.

08:36.300 --> 08:37.620
Then I'm going to give her height.

08:38.870 --> 08:39.290
Oops!

08:39.380 --> 08:42.140
It's going to be after the error

08:46.130 --> 08:48.230
of about 45 dpi.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.240
And while I'm here, I'm going to give a broader right because I want to create this structure, this

08:57.240 --> 08:58.290
nice border there.

08:59.490 --> 09:00.660
I see the border.

09:00.660 --> 09:08.010
I'm going to pass the width of this border about four deep and I'm going to pass a brush object there

09:08.040 --> 09:13.190
to our own so that we can actually create a nice linear gradient here.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.280
I'm going to say brush.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.580
Linear, they say brush that linear.

09:23.870 --> 09:32.690
Gradient as such, and so for our gradient here, I'm going to pass colors, highlights a list like

09:32.690 --> 09:33.050
this.

09:33.560 --> 09:45.590
And there's a list of in, let's say, app colors that aim off dark purple and then app colors and of.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.480
Dark purple again.

09:49.070 --> 09:53.970
OK, so what I'm doing here, I'm just going to create the same gradient using the same color, that's

09:53.970 --> 09:55.140
why you have something like this.

09:55.730 --> 09:57.830
So they sent me a line, right?

09:57.840 --> 10:02.340
And then I'm going to add a shape, just get rounded.

10:06.070 --> 10:15.550
Going to use a rounded corners shape and pass about 15 deep and then what I want to do, I want to clip.

10:18.110 --> 10:28.910
With a rounded corners shape such and I'm going to say top and percentage, top start percentage.

10:29.360 --> 10:40.670
I'm going to give 50 percent and top end percentage, also 50 percent and bottom and.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.570
Percentage, the same bottom start percentage.

10:47.650 --> 10:53.710
Yes, you guessed it the same, but as it is right now, we would have this nice round user interface

10:53.710 --> 10:54.010
there.

10:54.160 --> 10:59.170
However, it would all be covered in the same with the same color or want to do instead.

10:59.410 --> 11:03.250
We want to make the background transparent, but only show.

11:03.430 --> 11:07.080
Of course, this this brush that we added there.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.910
Write this with this stroke there.

11:10.270 --> 11:14.050
So it said over a clip, we finished our clip right about there.

11:14.530 --> 11:17.560
You can see because this to this is now highlighted.

11:18.640 --> 11:25.570
I'm going to say enter dot and I'm going to say background color when I make colored or transparent

11:25.810 --> 11:26.320
as such.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.810
OK, so we're making good progress.

11:28.990 --> 11:33.190
But in the next video, we are going to continue here and hopefully by the end, we're going to see

11:33.190 --> 11:34.870
something like this at least.

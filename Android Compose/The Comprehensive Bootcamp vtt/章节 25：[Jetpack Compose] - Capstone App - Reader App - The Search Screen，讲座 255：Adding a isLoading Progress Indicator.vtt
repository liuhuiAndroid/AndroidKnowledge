00:00.360 --> 00:07.310
Now, one thing you'll notice, if you run this again, you'll see something that it's OK but could

00:07.330 --> 00:07.800
be improved.

00:07.800 --> 00:08.550
So if I click.

00:09.780 --> 00:13.830
This blank and then something happens now, although it works fine, that's great.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.750
But for user interface, it's be nice to give some sort of indication that something is working in the

00:18.750 --> 00:19.290
background.

00:19.290 --> 00:20.160
Something is loading.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.730
And so we should just wait until something happens, right?

00:24.000 --> 00:30.630
Same thing happens if I say money, for instance, it just goes and shows it was quick.

00:30.630 --> 00:36.180
But it's nice sometimes to show that there's an indication that something is happening to back and background

00:36.180 --> 00:38.310
so users can wait for a bit.

00:38.610 --> 00:38.850
OK.

00:39.750 --> 00:40.710
So how do we do this now?

00:40.860 --> 00:47.250
Are different ways to do this, the way we have things set up right now in our book search view model

00:47.250 --> 00:47.640
here.

00:47.920 --> 00:54.660
I will want let us do how we usually do, which means we're not going to wrap this inside of another

00:54.810 --> 00:58.770
class where we can like a resource in this case, right?

00:58.790 --> 01:09.760
Or we can then have access to this states and so forth can just create a variable here called is loading.

01:09.840 --> 01:17.820
It's going to be a Boolean type and let's say by mutable state of say, true.

01:18.990 --> 01:19.590
To start with.

01:19.650 --> 01:19.920
Right.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.170
And this is loading.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.300
I can't say, for instance.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.940
So at the top here, I can say, is loading.

01:29.420 --> 01:40.570
That is, loadings go to try to set it to true first and then once we are done with our list here,

01:40.600 --> 01:48.950
I am going to say if this list is not empty, then I'm going to say is loading.

01:51.860 --> 01:52.700
Set it to false.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.550
Because we no longer need to be loading.

01:56.120 --> 02:01.430
And we're going to do the same thing when if something happens like it, it isn't ever going to say

02:01.430 --> 02:01.960
false.

02:01.970 --> 02:07.070
And of course, you can also say false there, as well as if there's an exception just to get rid of

02:07.070 --> 02:07.250
that.

02:07.790 --> 02:15.050
OK, now if we go to read our books, our search screen, they can just play around with something here.

02:15.120 --> 02:24.860
And so, for instance, if I write a few model that is loading is true, then I'm going to just say

02:24.950 --> 02:27.680
linear progress indicator.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.470
Like that?

02:33.320 --> 02:43.070
Else then, we're good to go then, and we just can't take all of this and add it there, and we no

02:43.070 --> 02:43.940
longer need this.

02:43.940 --> 02:47.480
This was just for us to play around and see what's going on.

02:48.980 --> 02:55.070
Now we're going to get some, hopefully some something that will tell users that something is working

02:55.070 --> 02:59.270
in the background, so they have some sort of visual aid as to what's happening.

03:00.290 --> 03:01.790
Instead of just a blank screen.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.270
Let's see.

03:07.690 --> 03:08.110
Oops!

03:08.140 --> 03:10.750
Looks like I'm having some issues, what did I do wrong?

03:11.950 --> 03:12.580
Right?

03:12.670 --> 03:13.960
Let's go back.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.210
Book search.

03:17.720 --> 03:18.110
Right.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.390
So I found it to be.

03:21.670 --> 03:29.080
Problematic whenever we are, I signing a value such as this interview model scope, whenever we if

03:29.080 --> 03:30.400
we pass dispatcher.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.390
So every time I remove the dispatcher, it seems to work less run again.

03:41.520 --> 03:48.420
And you can see there it is, it showed there can go back here and click, OK, so there's that nice

03:49.380 --> 03:50.160
animation there.

03:50.520 --> 03:55.730
The other thing I can do instead of calling here, let's put it back what we had before, I can just

03:55.740 --> 04:01.220
remove that because we know that in the beginning, it's set to true.

04:01.230 --> 04:06.070
So we don't really need to add that at this point here, which is what triggers that problem.

04:06.090 --> 04:08.490
OK, let's go ahead and run again.

04:10.850 --> 04:17.170
And you can see well, let's see if we search for Android again, you can search for whatever you want

04:17.180 --> 04:20.930
and that just went straight and showed the books.

04:21.150 --> 04:22.100
Okay, let's see.

04:30.910 --> 04:31.170
OK.

04:31.900 --> 04:32.380
Very nice.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.420
So we're getting all the information that we need.

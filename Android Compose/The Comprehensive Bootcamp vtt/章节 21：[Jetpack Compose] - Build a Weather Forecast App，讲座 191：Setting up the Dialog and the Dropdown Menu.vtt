WEBVTT

00:01.510 --> 00:09.670
All right, so next, we want to be able to when users click on this icon here, the action button more

00:09.850 --> 00:14.840
we want to populate or show a dialogue that has something like this.

00:14.860 --> 00:16.540
My favorites about settings.

00:17.070 --> 00:18.490
OK, so how do we do this?

00:19.060 --> 00:20.410
Well, first of all, have to think about it.

00:20.410 --> 00:29.320
So in order for us to show something like this, in order for us to show a dialogue, we need to create

00:29.320 --> 00:29.920
a state.

00:30.480 --> 00:35.610
Now all of that has to happen inside of our app bar.

00:35.710 --> 00:36.430
So if you go.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.760
Let's go and find our weather app bar.

00:39.850 --> 00:40.420
There it is.

00:40.750 --> 00:41.260
Open it.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.450
So in our weather app out of here, we want to make sure to create a state variable.

00:50.240 --> 00:56.800
I top here and let's say Val show dialogue.

00:57.930 --> 00:59.030
It's going to be a remember.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.780
And there were multiple state.

01:10.890 --> 01:14.040
Of false to start with.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.200
We have to import remember and such.

01:20.370 --> 01:23.520
So in the beginning, this show dialogue, is it going to be false?

01:23.670 --> 01:25.080
But when do we change that?

01:25.380 --> 01:30.750
Well, we change that when we click, of course, on the icon.

01:31.260 --> 01:31.980
Where is that?

01:33.320 --> 01:41.120
Well, the icon is here, the more icon, so I'm going to say show dialogue and value.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.010
It's going to be true.

01:43.700 --> 01:49.130
This is just to remind you that when it comes to showing dialogues in compose, you have to go through

01:49.130 --> 01:54.880
this very strange process if you ask me just a little bit strange, but that's what we have.

01:54.900 --> 01:55.790
That's where we have to do.

01:55.970 --> 01:59.210
So we need to have a state of showing and.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.860
Not showing it so on or off.

02:02.400 --> 02:09.090
OK, so now we're going to put in if statement here to say if show dialogue is true, so say that value.

02:09.540 --> 02:16.560
If it's true, you can just say like that, then that's where we're going to invoke the show setting

02:17.250 --> 02:19.890
drop down menu.

02:20.190 --> 02:22.680
Yes, a long name, but it's it's going to work.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.400
So for this one, I'm going to actually pass the show dialogue.

02:29.770 --> 02:35.530
Going to be our show dialogue state, and I'm going to also pass on NAF controller.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.710
Like this, you you'll see why.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.320
Let's go ahead and create this composable.

02:47.070 --> 02:51.060
At the bottom, there are good even gave us this mutable state.

02:52.990 --> 02:54.440
Will state it's very good.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.060
It's quite an import.

02:56.630 --> 02:57.020
Very good.

02:57.590 --> 03:01.580
OK, so I'm going to create this structure here.

03:01.610 --> 03:07.340
The actual body of the dialogue that I'm going to put inside of a column.

03:09.850 --> 03:10.900
How did modifier

03:14.590 --> 03:15.970
fail, Max with.

03:17.170 --> 03:19.840
And the next thing I'm going to do.

03:21.430 --> 03:24.400
Let's say rap content size.

03:25.030 --> 03:25.360
OK.

03:26.820 --> 03:27.690
And when I say top.

03:32.690 --> 03:36.170
Sara, linemate, I want to put that at the top, so alignment.

03:42.330 --> 03:49.650
Top end that is, then I'm going to add what we call the absolute padding so that it doesn't change

03:50.430 --> 03:52.260
depending on other factors.

03:52.260 --> 03:58.110
So for the top, I'm going to give an absolute padding of about four to five dpi, right?

03:58.170 --> 04:00.840
It's going to be about 22 dpi.

04:02.890 --> 04:09.430
OK, now inside of our column here, I'm going to invoke the drop down menu.

04:10.330 --> 04:18.880
Now the drop down menu, as you see now a dropdown menu is a composable that we get from compose, which

04:18.880 --> 04:21.580
is very awesome, as you see here.

04:22.030 --> 04:24.610
And so it will require a few things.

04:24.610 --> 04:29.390
So first of all, the expanded variable here, which is a Boolean.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.950
So this will control whether we're showing it or not.

04:33.280 --> 04:33.640
OK.

04:34.000 --> 04:44.530
We have to create here another variable called expanded, let's say by remember like this?

04:46.050 --> 04:47.220
Mutable state.

04:50.610 --> 04:51.390
Say true.

04:51.510 --> 04:57.870
In the beginning like that, now we have to import a few things to make this work.

04:58.650 --> 04:59.070
There we go.

04:59.520 --> 05:04.860
And so this expanded, it's going to be called there as a state.

05:09.330 --> 05:12.900
Now on this missile request, what are we going to do?

05:12.930 --> 05:21.780
We are going to set our expandable expanded, I should say, to false because we want to dismiss that

05:21.780 --> 05:22.530
means expanded.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.550
It's going to be false, which is a state, and then it's going to be dismissed.

05:26.610 --> 05:27.090
Dismissed.

05:28.020 --> 05:28.280
OK.

05:29.100 --> 05:35.430
That's what we need to add now, because drop menu is just like any other composable.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.980
We can also pass a modifier here and say, modifier,

05:40.920 --> 05:46.080
and I'm going to give a width of this modifier drop down, right?

05:47.040 --> 05:49.740
You know, about 140 dpi.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.390
Let's give a background.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.940
Just give me a white background as such.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.760
Let's see if this works as it is so far.

06:06.630 --> 06:07.980
Well, it's working.

06:08.430 --> 06:08.890
That's good.

06:09.030 --> 06:13.320
Click, it's not very eventful, but you saw that working there.

06:13.350 --> 06:13.650
OK.

06:13.710 --> 06:14.190
No problem.

06:14.730 --> 06:15.060
All right.

06:15.330 --> 06:22.320
So next, what we want to do is we want to, of course, show each one of these items which are actually

06:22.320 --> 06:23.820
clickable items, right?

06:24.540 --> 06:25.170
How do we do that?

06:25.380 --> 06:31.690
Well, to simplify our lives, I'm going to create a list of all those items.

06:32.220 --> 06:34.150
Some with several items.

06:35.160 --> 06:42.370
That's going to be a list of elements such and then for someone to say favorites.

06:43.110 --> 06:43.470
OK.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.050
And then about.

06:48.390 --> 06:52.380
In fact, let's just start with about this.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.930
And then favorites.

07:05.430 --> 07:08.490
And then last, we don't have settings like this.

07:09.990 --> 07:18.120
So what I'm going to do then here, I'm going to use all of those when I see items.

07:20.130 --> 07:20.300
Right.

07:20.870 --> 07:29.550
When he used a for each with index, for each index, the such and so we're going to have index and

07:29.550 --> 07:33.960
we're going to have the actual text right could be asked to be anything.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.300
I just say, yes, that's fine.

07:39.890 --> 07:40.790
Texas fine.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.740
And then this is where.

07:54.060 --> 07:57.270
I'm going to call a drop down.

07:59.300 --> 08:06.530
Menu item, because remember, each one of these is going to be a menu item drop down list such.

08:11.390 --> 08:18.470
And let's see, let's make this a land grab, because that's going to help our case like that.

08:18.500 --> 08:18.920
There we go.

08:19.580 --> 08:23.840
And each dropdown menu will have, of course, on click event.

08:25.930 --> 08:36.790
And what we want to do instead of the quick event, we're going to see expanded said that to false and

08:36.790 --> 08:40.090
then we're going to say show dialogue, not value.

08:43.510 --> 08:44.860
And said that to false as well.

08:45.310 --> 08:51.520
So essentially, once we click on either one of these, we're going to get rid of this dialogue.

08:53.570 --> 08:58.010
All right, so now let's go ahead and look at creating these items there.

08:58.550 --> 09:03.410
So, all right, so now let's go ahead and create which one of these items, because remember, we are

09:03.410 --> 09:05.900
inside of a for loop really here.

09:06.230 --> 09:14.120
So we're going to create now this one of each one of these right now because I know there are three

09:14.120 --> 09:17.220
different rules per se right here.

09:17.240 --> 09:21.500
What I'm going to do for the icon, I'm going to see create an icon like this.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.380
And for the image.

09:26.720 --> 09:32.300
Description, content description, the signal for now, but now for each one of this image, because

09:32.300 --> 09:34.670
I want different images of different icons, right?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.280
I need to check to see.

09:38.470 --> 09:44.230
Which one of these, if its favorite about or settings, right, if it's favored, I'm going to have

09:44.230 --> 09:50.290
a heart that's about it going to have this information and then this tool thing, therefore settings.

09:50.920 --> 09:58.180
OK, so to do that and when to use it, when statement real quick here and going to pass the text because

09:58.180 --> 10:04.870
this text is going to be white, it's going to be each one of these texts that we have in our list.

10:06.010 --> 10:11.800
So depending on the text, if it's about first the icon.

10:14.770 --> 10:16.870
It's going to be icons that default.

10:18.010 --> 10:18.970
I'm going to add info.

10:21.770 --> 10:22.130
OK.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.560
Let's important

10:28.160 --> 10:37.280
now, if the case is favorites, then icons our default.

10:39.410 --> 10:40.460
And say favorite.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.930
Border like this.

10:45.650 --> 10:48.830
And then else we just have one more case, really.

10:49.490 --> 10:54.020
I'm just going to say it's going to be all right, Colin is the default.

10:57.570 --> 10:58.200
Settings.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.020
Like that?

11:02.760 --> 11:05.080
We don't need commerce.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.500
All right, analysts and.

11:09.560 --> 11:15.920
Tent color for each one of these colored light gray.

11:17.450 --> 11:18.560
Let's put a comment on

11:21.710 --> 11:22.160
that.

11:22.940 --> 11:28.130
And then right below that or actually altered it to the right, I'm going to add a text.

11:32.930 --> 11:36.200
So essentially now I'm adding this text here, that's part

11:39.170 --> 11:45.680
and four texts are going to be text right now inside of for a loop, so we will know to grab the correct

11:45.680 --> 11:46.160
text.

11:46.670 --> 11:47.540
So modifier.

11:52.450 --> 11:56.620
When I make this clickable and because it's still a text.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.980
Say font weight.

12:04.280 --> 12:11.410
So three hundred, I say, but wait, and that's fine, OK?

12:12.460 --> 12:13.640
We did a lot of things.

12:13.660 --> 12:16.540
Let's go ahead and see if this works and go ahead and run.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.710
OK, I can see it works, OK.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.340
It's quick.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.050
They would go say about.

12:27.990 --> 12:33.180
And you click somewhere outside the actual menu items and goes away.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.430
OK, so it's working.

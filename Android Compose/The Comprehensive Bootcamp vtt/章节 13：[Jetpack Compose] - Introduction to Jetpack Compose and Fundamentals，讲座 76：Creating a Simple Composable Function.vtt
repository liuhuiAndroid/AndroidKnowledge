00:00.650 --> 00:09.200
So everything you see to the right here comes from our preview, so any function that has ad preview

00:09.620 --> 00:11.030
will be previewed here.

00:11.390 --> 00:16.640
That means if I come here and create another composable, we need to start at composable and there we

00:16.640 --> 00:16.940
go.

00:17.390 --> 00:23.750
The ad was going to help us hit enter and then it's a fun show age, for instance.

00:24.170 --> 00:26.740
In this case, I'm going to pass age.

00:27.350 --> 00:28.610
It's going to be an integer type.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.530
And then here I can say text enter.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.590
That's the first option.

00:34.310 --> 00:37.250
And all we want is the first one, which is just a simple text.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.300
So hit enter.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.940
And then here I'm going to say age like this.

00:41.660 --> 00:44.300
OK, now we still may have the same problem.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.870
If you have it over there, say, OK, some issues are there now.

00:47.870 --> 00:52.040
The reason why I know what's going up here, if you have it over, is going to say parameter age is

00:52.040 --> 01:01.760
an integer, but this text widget here only allows us to pass in a blistering song I say to string for

01:01.760 --> 01:03.890
now, just to simplify our lives.

01:04.700 --> 01:10.310
OK, so we have this show age who pass age int it's essentially similar to this.

01:10.610 --> 01:10.910
OK.

01:11.810 --> 01:16.790
So what happens here if I want it to be previewed here like I can do?

01:16.790 --> 01:18.410
So how do I do that?

01:18.800 --> 01:23.510
Well, at the top, I'm going to say at preview something like this.

01:24.650 --> 01:30.530
Now we have a problem because it says if you have always going to say composable functions with nine

01:30.530 --> 01:36.020
default parameters are not supported in preview unless they are annotated with preview parameter.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.420
What this means is that, well, because we seeing age here, we say, is integer.

01:41.810 --> 01:48.110
We need to pass some sort of default values so that it's picked up in our preview here.

01:48.890 --> 01:56.360
So when you do that to say equals 12 and you can see this is gone and now can see, says show there,

01:56.360 --> 01:57.530
but we don't see anything.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.630
Let's go ahead and refresh.

02:01.970 --> 02:08.120
And while you can see you see 12, if you click, it's going to go straight to where we created that

02:08.120 --> 02:08.750
text there.

02:09.140 --> 02:15.070
Also, you can see that we have this show age, which is the name of the composable function that would

02:15.380 --> 02:22.400
create it now because this is a composable I could call show age inside of our entire compose theme

02:22.400 --> 02:23.420
as well as at the bottom.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.910
Here you can see show age.

02:28.070 --> 02:32.060
And, of course, because we have a default value for age.

02:33.180 --> 02:40.140
Nothing will happens, but I can see if I want to age 30 for such should see something here.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.880
Let's go ahead and refresh.

02:46.310 --> 02:50.450
And well, now here's a problem, it's there.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.450
I can promise you that it's there, but it's on top of each other.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.100
What's really going on here?

02:55.550 --> 03:00.940
Well, what happens is because we're just passing inside of this intro to compose theme.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.420
There's no layout.

03:02.420 --> 03:06.230
There's no way that composable will know exactly where am I going to put this?

03:06.350 --> 03:10.160
So what happens is that it just puts things on top of each other.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.990
So if you really want to see what's going on, we can put inside of a column.

03:15.350 --> 03:21.650
It's a column will always put things on top, will always put things vertically right below each other.

03:21.650 --> 03:30.230
So when I see column subtyping column, I search and you can see this is indeed, of course, another.

03:32.050 --> 03:39.940
Lambda, everything is a lambda, and we can pass all modifiers and so forth here to structure our column.

03:40.150 --> 03:46.570
But for now, it's OK, we're just going to go and put all of these inside it there the square and refresh.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.980
And just like that, now you can see that we have hello, Android and 34, because we put that inside

03:53.980 --> 03:57.400
of a column which is going to structure everything vertically.

03:57.790 --> 04:02.380
Again, if you want to know more about a column, you can hover over and you can read all of this stuff.

04:03.780 --> 04:06.510
OK, so now what is up here?

04:06.540 --> 04:08.370
Let's look at this content.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.110
So this content here.

04:10.170 --> 04:15.720
As the name implies, this is where we are setting the content so that it can be viewed on an actual

04:15.720 --> 04:17.850
device or Emily or so forth, right?

04:18.360 --> 04:24.480
So in this case, you can see we have a main activity inherits one component activity we have on create.

04:24.480 --> 04:28.500
So this is the entry point to our entry point to our project.

04:29.220 --> 04:35.220
So here we are, setting the content yet another lambda and we're passing the entire compose who remember

04:35.220 --> 04:37.320
this guy from down here, right?

04:37.350 --> 04:38.070
Same guy.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.360
Same thing, right?

04:39.690 --> 04:46.470
He sets up the entire view, according to the default theme of the project.

04:47.100 --> 04:55.800
And then another compose we pass inside here the surface, which is another which is another compose,

04:57.340 --> 05:00.750
which is not a compose, and it has also trained lambda.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.850
So everything is about lambda is here.

05:03.600 --> 05:03.940
Very good.

05:04.380 --> 05:08.340
So here it says a surface container using the background color from the theme.

05:08.340 --> 05:13.770
So its surface is just in the main, the most primitive, the most basic canvas.

05:14.310 --> 05:17.220
And as you can see, we can pass a few arguments here.

05:17.400 --> 05:23.430
Color and we said the color from our material theme that we saw before we could colors and we get the

05:23.430 --> 05:23.970
background.

05:25.030 --> 05:25.380
OK.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.290
And that's where we passing quilting Android.

05:28.870 --> 05:35.950
This is going to be called when we run this app on the emulator, so if I go ahead and run this app,

05:36.160 --> 05:38.470
make sure you have, of course, an emulator.

05:39.640 --> 05:44.140
So the idea is that when we run, we should see this creeping android.

05:45.310 --> 05:45.640
OK.

05:45.730 --> 05:51.610
You can see after a few moments, you can see, Hello, Android, so whatever we pass here instead of

05:51.610 --> 05:54.850
said content, it's not going to be in our preview, right?

05:54.890 --> 05:57.160
So the preview is to preview whatever we doing.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.140
We call in great greeting.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.280
The same thing that we see here is for us to preview.

06:02.290 --> 06:07.830
We're also calling another composable that we created at the top there, which incidentally also has

06:07.840 --> 06:08.290
preview.

06:08.290 --> 06:11.980
We can remove that preview if we want it to and so forth.

06:11.980 --> 06:19.000
So whatever we pass here inside of our set content, it is indeed what we see there.

06:21.220 --> 06:28.150
The beauty also here, let's toggle the coat on me, is that if I set a different color, let's say

06:28.150 --> 06:34.180
I want see colors and let's see what else I'm going to get.

06:35.610 --> 06:39.440
Let's get the primary to see what's going to happen, let's go ahead and rerun this.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.880
And you can see now the background over a surface, which is this.

06:45.980 --> 06:46.340
Right.

06:47.530 --> 06:51.760
That's enclosing our greeting, which is what we have at the bottom here.

06:52.010 --> 06:55.060
It's a composable it changed the colors now.

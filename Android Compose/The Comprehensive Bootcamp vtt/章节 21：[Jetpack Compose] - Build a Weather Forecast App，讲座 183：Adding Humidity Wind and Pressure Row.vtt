WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:06.770
All right, let's move on and create this section here, so it's going to be a row, as you see.

00:07.130 --> 00:12.200
And it's easy to put together, I think now because we want to divide up all of the composable.

00:12.200 --> 00:21.290
So we're going to create a new composable wind pressure through quite a long name.

00:21.290 --> 00:21.860
But that works.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.090
I'm going to pass a weather.

00:24.590 --> 00:31.700
Here it's going to be data zero day, and at least actually I think I already have the weather item,

00:31.700 --> 00:33.590
I think we call a weather item.

00:34.380 --> 00:34.940
Very good.

00:37.280 --> 00:45.260
And there we go, so now let's go ahead and create this precious composable weather item.

00:45.770 --> 00:48.830
OK, so what's going to happen with our weather item?

00:49.490 --> 00:55.730
Well, in this case here, I'm going to create a row in my past, my fire.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.660
Padding of about 12 dpi.

01:06.020 --> 01:08.210
Phil Max with.

01:13.660 --> 01:20.110
And let me say vertical alignment to one center vertically.

01:20.320 --> 01:20.800
Oops.

01:28.460 --> 01:32.630
And I want arrangement space between.

01:33.380 --> 01:39.770
So I'm creating this outer row, but then inside for each one of these items, I'm going to have another

01:39.770 --> 01:43.940
row right or icon and then the number.

01:46.210 --> 01:50.920
So another row site here, and we actually have.

01:54.280 --> 01:54.940
Tomorrow.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.640
It's a passive modifier.

02:10.050 --> 02:12.020
It before patting.

02:13.370 --> 02:16.070
And first thing I'm going to add here is an icon.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.680
And we already added these.

02:20.700 --> 02:24.120
I'm going to say painter resource, and I'm going to say.

02:25.230 --> 02:32.550
For IDR Dot Tribal and guests to humidity first.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.960
Aha, we need to import our wonderful are.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.950
Let's start over because.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.070
Get Drabble humidity.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.120
This needs to be a painter.

02:53.570 --> 02:54.140
There we go.

02:59.720 --> 03:06.080
And this is going to be, say, humility icon the modifier.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.720
TDP.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.920
And then after that, I'm going to pass a text.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.260
That's going to be.

03:29.010 --> 03:36.470
Learn to use our weather and get humidity, say, to a string.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.490
Looks like we don't need that.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.310
And I'm going to put a percentage of such.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.080
Let's give us style.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.500
Could caption, OK?

04:08.720 --> 04:14.450
And all of this going to be pretty much the same for all of them, so with minor changes.

04:15.350 --> 04:20.180
Let's just add that and this is going to be pressure.

04:23.910 --> 04:24.750
Pressure.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.260
And pressure.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.150
I say PCI for pressure.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.230
That's fine.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.330
Let's go ahead and do that.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.510
And this is going to be wind.

04:49.070 --> 04:50.210
Miles per hour.

04:51.050 --> 04:51.380
All right.

04:51.860 --> 04:54.500
Let's go ahead and run and see if we can see something, hopefully.

04:56.490 --> 04:56.790
OK.

04:57.150 --> 04:57.450
All right.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.900
That's nice, except it's not where we want it to be, it's right up there.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.840
That means I want this to be down here.

05:04.440 --> 05:12.690
The problem here, it seems to me that our humidity pressure, I'm calling outside of our column.

05:12.690 --> 05:16.410
So then I put a right inside there, I believe.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.220
Let's see.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.350
Yes, that's the column.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.180
Yes, I think that would work.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.150
The outer one.

05:24.300 --> 05:24.900
Let's see.

05:26.670 --> 05:27.000
OK.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.350
Looks at way, way better.

05:28.530 --> 05:30.060
That's exactly where we want it to be.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.400
And it looks just like this.

05:32.970 --> 05:33.780
As you can see there.

05:34.140 --> 05:34.650
All right.

05:35.400 --> 05:35.970
Very good.

05:36.300 --> 05:36.900
Very good indeed.

05:37.140 --> 05:37.410
All right.

05:37.590 --> 05:40.440
So next we are going to add this divider there.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.370
It's very easy.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.550
So just go back right there.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.370
I'm going to say the Vidar like that.

05:49.440 --> 05:49.650
And.

05:50.500 --> 05:50.970
Very good.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.810
Just like that, our app is starting to look really nice.

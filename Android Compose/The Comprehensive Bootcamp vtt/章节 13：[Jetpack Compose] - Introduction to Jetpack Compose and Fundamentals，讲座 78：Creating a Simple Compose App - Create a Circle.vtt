WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:02.160
So here's what we're going to do next.

00:02.220 --> 00:04.260
We're going to create a very simple application.

00:04.680 --> 00:10.830
What are we going to have a button of some sort or tappable UI widget?

00:11.220 --> 00:17.250
And when that is tapped like this circle is tapped, we want to increment the amount of money we'll

00:17.250 --> 00:18.390
see at the top there.

00:18.630 --> 00:25.380
So it's a very simple app, but it will give us some insights into compose and how certain things work.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.510
All right, let's go ahead and get started.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.520
So back in our project, let's clean things up.

00:30.570 --> 00:32.670
So there are a lot of things that we no longer need.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.820
In this case, I'm just going to get rid of all of this.

00:38.590 --> 00:38.910
OK.

00:39.550 --> 00:45.550
And then get rid of this switch just for testing purposes, I'm going to get rid of this composable

00:46.090 --> 00:49.390
as well, which means this needs to go.

00:49.870 --> 00:50.920
Can't do that anymore.

00:51.010 --> 00:51.310
OK.

00:51.910 --> 00:52.180
All right.

00:52.180 --> 00:58.240
So the first thing I'm going to do here inside of our set content we are passing, of course, the composed

00:58.240 --> 01:04.210
theme I don't have a surface we've talked about is taking over the entire screen at this point because

01:04.210 --> 01:06.820
we have max height and max width.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.990
We add some padding and at this point, let's just get rid of that because we're not going to need that.

01:11.350 --> 01:12.970
Of course, forget our comma there.

01:13.510 --> 01:20.410
OK, now one thing I want to do is, in fact, let's come back now.

01:20.420 --> 01:26.200
One thing I want to do is I want to remove this surface outside into its own place.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.260
So I'm going to create another composable here.

01:29.260 --> 01:29.920
So say at.

01:31.720 --> 01:39.700
Space at composable are such a fun call, is my app OK?

01:41.530 --> 01:48.160
And then for this, my app here, what I'm going to do, I'm going to get this entire surface there,

01:48.220 --> 01:52.600
but this is going to be our canvas for, say, I'm going to put it here as such.

01:54.220 --> 01:54.520
OK.

01:56.340 --> 02:02.540
And then for now, inside here, let's just say text and say hello.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.160
OK, I'm going to call my app, of course, inside here.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.260
My app has a composable.

02:11.650 --> 02:12.190
Very good.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.490
And then also my app here.

02:15.490 --> 02:18.940
So this is just a very simple way of organizing our composable.

02:19.210 --> 02:24.460
So we want to have it inside here because we want to be able to see in our preview here.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.780
So I'm going to go ahead and refresh.

02:32.570 --> 02:36.110
And there you have it, so we get what we are looking for.

02:36.350 --> 02:41.690
And the other thing you see to the right bottom right here, we can actually toggle the present.

02:41.930 --> 02:44.090
We can actually toggle the views here.

02:44.090 --> 02:48.140
I can maximize or zoom in or minimize zoom out.

02:48.590 --> 02:52.280
So in this case, if I go to click the Zoom to fit screen, click here.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.990
I can see it's going to go ahead and zoom to fit this real estate we have.

02:57.530 --> 02:57.830
OK.

02:59.150 --> 03:02.210
All right, so we have everything looking good, so there is the color.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.310
Primary color, because that's where we chose.

03:04.820 --> 03:11.480
The other thing I can do if I want to, for instance, add a customized color, I can get rid of this

03:12.140 --> 03:15.890
and I can invoke color classes that and pass.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.840
And pass in its constructor, I'm going to pass the.

03:23.770 --> 03:31.060
Code that will represent different culture that I want, right, so to pass the tax code as they seek

03:31.510 --> 03:34.630
to pass a hex code here, which will represent a color.

03:35.020 --> 03:39.610
The first thing they have to do this is zero X. And then I already have the I'm just going to.

03:40.450 --> 03:42.370
And then I already have the color somewhere.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.270
Go and find it.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.970
And I'm going to add it there.

03:46.620 --> 03:52.140
The other thing I'm going to add, I'm going CFF to begin with like this.

03:53.370 --> 03:55.090
And then the actual color, OK?

03:56.220 --> 03:57.960
Looks like this.

03:58.410 --> 03:59.220
All right, there we go.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.290
So these colors here, it doesn't matter, really.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.830
You can put whatever you want, but I just found that color to be great.

04:04.830 --> 04:07.650
So I'm going to go ahead and refresh this real quick to see the differences.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.590
OK, so there we go.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.340
We have that very nice color there.

04:11.460 --> 04:11.850
Very good.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.080
So that was a test.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.270
I'm going to get rid of this and continue.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.280
Now the next thing I want.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.530
So what is all I want to do?

04:18.540 --> 04:23.070
First of all, when I create a circle inside here, the different ways to create a circle.

04:23.280 --> 04:29.220
So I'm going to create yet another composable here, say at composable such.

04:31.260 --> 04:35.670
It's call safe fun, and I say create.

04:37.260 --> 04:37.980
Circle.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.100
Like this?

04:41.480 --> 04:41.630
OK.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.110
And inside here, I'm going to create a circle.

04:45.170 --> 04:46.310
How do I create a circle?

04:46.560 --> 04:52.370
As I said, there are different ways, but the basics is that we need to have some sort of the baseline

04:52.370 --> 04:54.140
or we have to have some sort of.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.520
The main composable we can call and then we can modify it.

04:59.270 --> 05:04.430
So let's start with a card or something and say, card it like this, so it is a composable hit enter.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.690
And for now, also I'm going to go ahead and make this reviewable.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.970
So that way I can also preview to the right here.

05:11.510 --> 05:21.350
So at preview such and in this card here, if you hover over, you will see that there are a lot of

05:21.830 --> 05:23.360
arguments that we can pass.

05:24.500 --> 05:30.470
Most important one, we have this modifier and we have the shape and background and so forth.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.930
And one thing that is very important the order in which these are added is very important as well.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.870
OK, so let's start with the modifier, because, well, allow us to modify.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.640
I didn't even play our card.

05:42.720 --> 05:49.860
OK, so I hear I'm going to pass the same modifier as such, and the I.D. will help us just hit enter

05:50.130 --> 05:54.990
and then pass modifier, and then we can call whatever one can use padding.

05:55.170 --> 06:01.650
Just put three that deep right and I can chain or a modifier I've shown before.

06:02.040 --> 06:09.720
So what I want to do is, for instance, I can see dot background and give it color to the background.

06:10.290 --> 06:10.920
All sort of things.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.750
But the other thing I want to do, I will stop with the modifier for now if I hover over here.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.140
There are other things we can pass.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.360
The other one is shape.

06:18.870 --> 06:25.080
What shape do I want this to have or to take so I can come here with Colin?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.720
Or I should say, and what's a shape?

06:28.260 --> 06:30.620
Now there are different kinds of shape we can pass.

06:30.990 --> 06:35.520
In this case, I'm going to just see circle shape as such.

06:36.330 --> 06:40.080
So this card as it is right now, let's go ahead and run this or refresh.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.460
Let's see what's going to happen.

06:42.030 --> 06:43.710
You can see it's very small.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.470
There is the card, right?

06:45.900 --> 06:51.420
It doesn't have much because number one, we don't have a size and it doesn't even show the circle shape.

06:51.900 --> 06:52.950
Let's see something here.

06:53.190 --> 06:58.490
If I come back to our modifier, say Dot, I'm going to say width.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.710
I such and you say width.

07:01.710 --> 07:05.220
And also there is height so we can specify the width and height.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.860
But there's also another way of doing this, I could also pass this size.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.610
So there are overloaded sizes.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.600
Function size functions here we have this size.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.320
Here you can see we passed just one size, right?

07:19.770 --> 07:23.760
If you passed that one size, that means it's going to take up four width and height.

07:24.420 --> 07:28.080
But you can specify size for width and height.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.480
You can specify sizing and so many.

07:30.780 --> 07:35.920
Now let's go just to size and say, I want this to be about 45 that deep.

07:36.210 --> 07:39.660
OK, I section, let's refresh.

07:40.980 --> 07:41.760
And just like that.

07:41.940 --> 07:44.580
Ladies and gentlemen, you can see we have our circle.

07:46.050 --> 07:46.740
Very good.

07:47.130 --> 07:54.060
So again, because of modifier, we say padding, it's going to be about three deep and the size is

07:54.060 --> 07:57.990
going to be 45, so the smaller the size, obviously, the smaller the circle's going to be.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.310
And we say the shape of this card is going to be circle shaped.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.360
This is given to us.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.670
I can also say rectangle.

08:06.830 --> 08:10.910
Shaped like this, if you go ahead and refresh, you should see rectangle.

08:11.480 --> 08:18.620
And while you can see there is now the reason why it squares in a rectangle per say is because of the

08:18.620 --> 08:23.810
size that we gave, we we gave 45 for all of height and width.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.790
That's why we have square.

08:26.630 --> 08:27.740
OK, very well.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.710
So let's go back to circle what we had before.

08:30.860 --> 08:35.630
So instead of our trailing lambda here, that means we can add contents that we want to see inside of

08:35.630 --> 08:36.110
our card.

08:36.440 --> 08:41.780
So in this case, I can say text like this and say tat like that.

08:42.050 --> 08:42.710
Let's refresh.

08:43.070 --> 08:47.750
And you can see we have tap showing there, but we have a problem here.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.790
The tap is not in the middle.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.820
We want it to be in the middle of our card.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.820
Now there are different ways to deal with this issue.

08:55.910 --> 09:03.200
One of the quicker ways we have here to force the tap, the text we have here to be in the middle is

09:03.200 --> 09:11.510
to wrap this text into a box because a box will have because a box will have an argument, because a

09:11.510 --> 09:16.850
box will have a parameter that will allow us to set whatever is inside of his box to be in the middle.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.300
So what?

09:17.300 --> 09:19.910
I'm going to do a table and say box, and there we go.

09:20.420 --> 09:24.740
The first box there and I'm going to get all of that input inside.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.670
And if you have over it instead of a box, it is indeed a composable.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.650
Everything is pretty much a composable.

09:30.890 --> 09:37.910
Any jetpack compose and you can see we have modifier as the first parameter there and we have the content

09:37.910 --> 09:38.660
alignment.

09:39.440 --> 09:44.330
This is real good because it will allow us to align the contents inside of this box, which in this

09:44.330 --> 09:45.620
case is the text.

09:46.160 --> 09:52.880
So when I say content start typing content alignment, I'd expect an alignment object and say alignment,

09:52.880 --> 09:57.470
and there are different objects, zero different variables that we can pass.

09:58.610 --> 10:03.380
So the alignment we want is the center, OK, not top center.

10:03.380 --> 10:06.710
We want just the center as such a hit enter in Whyalla.

10:07.910 --> 10:08.750
OK, there we go.

10:08.750 --> 10:12.830
So let's see if this true, if I refresh this, I should be able to see tap now in the middle.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.770
So tap is now in the middle of our circle.

10:17.040 --> 10:23.700
That means if I make this a little bit bigger, you can see it doesn't matter how big or how small it

10:23.700 --> 10:25.950
is our card in this circle.

10:26.670 --> 10:27.810
It's always going to be in the middle.

10:28.350 --> 10:29.450
OK, there we go.

10:29.460 --> 10:30.420
And voila!

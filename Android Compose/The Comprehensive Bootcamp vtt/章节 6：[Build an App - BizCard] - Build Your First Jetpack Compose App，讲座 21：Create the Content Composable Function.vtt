WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:05.280
So the idea is to make sure that when we click on portfolio, we're going to see the list or a list

00:05.280 --> 00:08.240
containing projects, all of these is dummy data, of course.

00:08.250 --> 00:12.060
But what we want to do here want to make sure that, of course, all these data is going to be fake,

00:12.060 --> 00:15.180
but at least will have some sort of a complete application here.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.340
OK, so let's go ahead and do that.

00:17.820 --> 00:21.590
So for that, we are going to create yet another composable right.

00:21.900 --> 00:27.570
Different piece of code user interface code here, I'm going to say at composable.

00:27.810 --> 00:34.470
So anything that needs to show something to the user in this case, a user interface component, you

00:34.470 --> 00:36.030
have to pass at composable.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.020
OK, so once a fun for function, I'm going to call this content.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.100
All right, there we go.

00:41.130 --> 00:45.990
And for now, what I need to do, I want to make sure that I'm able to preview this one composable.

00:46.050 --> 00:49.700
To do that, we say at least start typing in preview as such.

00:49.860 --> 00:50.160
Very good.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.990
So we're going to focus on here.

00:52.140 --> 00:57.510
And so at this point, let's split this and you can see we have that preview, which is this one that

00:57.510 --> 00:58.170
we just started.

00:58.210 --> 00:59.280
Now it has nothing.

00:59.370 --> 01:04.440
And just to make sure that I don't have too much going on, I'm going to go ahead and comment this out,

01:04.740 --> 01:08.370
OK, so that we only have one preview, which is going to be this one here.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.270
There's nothing yet.

01:09.420 --> 01:10.320
OK, so what is that?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.000
We want to happen?

01:11.010 --> 01:15.470
So I'm going to use yet another composable that comes with compose called Box.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.810
So we're going to create a box that will contain all of this information.

01:19.170 --> 01:25.740
So again, when he just go ahead and say, Box and pass it modifier, I'm going to fill max height and

01:25.740 --> 01:29.160
then with a dot fill max with such.

01:29.160 --> 01:36.120
And then let's give it a padding dot because we still part of our modifier padding scheme about five

01:36.120 --> 01:36.950
dpi, I say.

01:37.380 --> 01:40.470
And then I forget to put all lambda in this case.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.700
This is the scope, right?

01:41.710 --> 01:43.750
What is going to be inside of our box there?

01:43.800 --> 01:46.470
We have to have those curly braces.

01:46.950 --> 01:47.380
OK.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.080
So inside here, what are we going to do?

01:49.110 --> 01:52.260
Well, we're going to put a surface high or no surface.

01:52.270 --> 01:54.420
So this is the canvas per se.

01:54.510 --> 01:58.590
But the great thing about surface is that obviously, like with anything we can pass and fired, we

01:58.590 --> 02:01.080
can customize our UI even further.

02:01.110 --> 02:01.380
OK.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.440
So for a surface here, I'm going to pass it and modifier.

02:04.630 --> 02:07.830
I see that padding going to give an all padding of about three that.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.220
And then I'm going to say, put that in a new line.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.620
Fill max width again.

02:13.630 --> 02:15.600
It's going to be max height.

02:16.080 --> 02:16.430
All right.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.200
So there we have it.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.420
So now inside of our surface, we can do all sorts of things.

02:20.430 --> 02:26.820
This is where we can add other UI components, but what do we want to happen in this surface?

02:26.860 --> 02:28.530
There's another thing we need to think about.

02:28.770 --> 02:33.510
If you look here, we want to have this nice aborder that is showing there, right?

02:33.510 --> 02:38.040
That's enclosing all of this content, all of this list, which we haven't looked at yet.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.240
So we need to create that.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.350
It's easy to create that.

02:40.350 --> 02:44.430
That's the reason why we have the surface because surface allows us to do all sort of thing.

02:44.670 --> 02:49.980
In fact, if you have all over, you can see a list of all of these properties, all of these parameters

02:49.980 --> 02:53.820
within paths to further customize our surface, which is great.

02:53.970 --> 03:00.510
So here after we've added Phil Max, Phil Max with, we can go ahead and say shape, for instance,

03:00.810 --> 03:07.140
what shape do we want this to have what we want to have some sort of a rounded corner shape like that

03:07.380 --> 03:08.460
in for the corner?

03:08.640 --> 03:14.820
I'm going to pass a corner cornices and pass here a six that dpi remember the higher this number we

03:14.820 --> 03:18.560
add here and the more curved this is going to be.

03:18.630 --> 03:19.710
And next, what do we need to do?

03:19.740 --> 03:23.880
We need to add a border because we want this to look like this good.

03:23.890 --> 03:25.610
It's very easy to do so.

03:26.010 --> 03:31.540
But remember, we still inside of the parameters here, like parentheses of our surface.

03:31.570 --> 03:32.310
That's very important.

03:32.520 --> 03:38.550
And let's say border state say border stroke and for border stroke, as you see we pass with and the

03:38.550 --> 03:43.620
color and you can override with other parameters as well, but we can check the first one first.

03:43.860 --> 03:46.590
So we're going to use the first override method.

03:46.740 --> 03:52.650
So I'm going to say width in this case, say a one, just two dpi, so not too thick in four color.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.870
I'm going to say is equal to color.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.360
And when the light gray like that?

03:57.510 --> 03:57.750
All right.

03:57.750 --> 04:02.160
Let's go ahead and refresh real quick to see if we are going to be able to see something at least.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.180
And there you have it.

04:03.180 --> 04:05.700
So you can see we do have our border.

04:05.850 --> 04:06.810
It's hard to see.

04:07.020 --> 04:11.640
But once we have something inside and everything is set up, it's going to be much easier.

04:11.940 --> 04:13.350
But believe me, it's there.

04:13.350 --> 04:17.700
If you can see a little bit, let's make this a little bigger or I'm going to remove my avatar so you

04:17.700 --> 04:18.160
can see.

04:18.180 --> 04:21.240
So just look around, you should see that border.

04:21.360 --> 04:26.410
In fact, if I change this to about 12 deep, you can see there it is really a large border.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.210
That's not what we want.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.050
So now what?

04:28.050 --> 04:33.930
We want to be inside here, what we want to be inside here, it's going to be yet another composable,

04:34.140 --> 04:36.960
which is we're going to call portfolio like this.

04:37.350 --> 04:38.340
We haven't created this.

04:38.670 --> 04:43.890
So this portfolio is going to take a few parameters which are going to be portfolios or I'm going to

04:43.890 --> 04:51.030
say data, OK, there's going to be a list of and we're just going to pass here, say Project one,

04:52.680 --> 04:53.320
just like that.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.260
OK, let's go ahead.

04:54.270 --> 04:59.940
I'm going to copy this, or I could just right click and say sure and go ahead and say, create composable.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.420
Function portfolio go.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.720
And voila, it's created, and that's fine.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.900
All right, very good.

05:05.920 --> 05:11.980
So now we have created another portfolio composable that is maybe a little bit strange at first.

05:12.010 --> 05:12.670
So what are we doing here?

05:12.910 --> 05:17.950
Well, we created this content composable, right, which is not being called anywhere yet, in fact.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.170
So it's going to be around somewhere here.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.060
But this is where our base card created.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.640
This card is this is the main composable.

05:24.970 --> 05:29.140
And so in our content compulsively here, we created a box inside of the box.

05:29.140 --> 05:35.860
We created surface and we banded quote-unquote this surface, meaning we customize it to have rounded

05:35.860 --> 05:40.300
corners and we added border and the light grey border color.

05:40.450 --> 05:40.750
OK.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.700
And then we passing it a portfolio in this portfolio.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.270
This is in the portfolio.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.600
Here is another composable.

05:46.600 --> 05:53.140
So you see you can create as many composable as you want and kind of add stack them on top of each other,

05:53.290 --> 05:54.400
if that makes any sense.

05:54.490 --> 05:55.680
That's how we compose.

05:55.690 --> 05:59.560
If you, if you will, our user interface declaratively.

05:59.740 --> 06:00.030
All right.

06:00.040 --> 06:05.770
So in this case, your portfolio is going to expect to receive a list of, in this case, are strings.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.110
Now we have refactor it out.

06:08.380 --> 06:12.100
So we have this composable that's been called inside here in this one.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.750
Here, of course, is going to expect that list.

06:13.910 --> 06:17.240
As we said here, it's going to be a list of strings, so we need to implement it.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.700
That's where we have that to do that.

06:19.270 --> 06:26.950
So for now, what I'm going to do for now, let's just say text, say portfolio projects, go here.

06:27.190 --> 06:28.600
OK, so we're making good progress.

06:28.870 --> 06:34.450
So next, we're going to work on our portfolio composable here, which is going to entail all of this.

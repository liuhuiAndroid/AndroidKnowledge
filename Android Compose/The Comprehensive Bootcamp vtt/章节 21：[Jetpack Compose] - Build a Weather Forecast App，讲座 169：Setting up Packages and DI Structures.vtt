00:00.450 --> 00:04.740
Next, let's go back to our project and the first thing I want to do because it's easy to forget.

00:04.770 --> 00:07.050
Let's go to our Android Manifest file.

00:07.470 --> 00:14.430
And here I'm going to add the internet permissions and it uses like smart uses permission and I'm just

00:14.430 --> 00:19.530
going to type internet like this hit enter or it's too close.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.690
So this is something easy to forget.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.530
I like to add that permission before we move forward.

00:25.650 --> 00:33.150
So this will allow us to be able to use the internet in order to get information from the eyes and so

00:33.150 --> 00:33.390
forth.

00:33.390 --> 00:34.350
So very important.

00:34.890 --> 00:35.130
All right.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.560
So once we then, that's fine.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.270
And the next thing I want to do here is I want to structure, of course, create all the packages that

00:42.270 --> 00:44.030
we may need in our project.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.540
That way we can organize our code.

00:45.900 --> 00:52.020
Remember, we're trying to create applications that are following the clean architecture.

00:52.170 --> 00:58.230
It really helps to put together the structure of our files of our classes and packages and so forth.

00:58.440 --> 01:04.060
That way, we have that structure in place like let's go inside of our main.

01:04.680 --> 01:09.990
So inside of our main package here and we're right click or command and.

01:11.660 --> 01:13.940
Think this and I can go say package.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.040
I'm going to start by.

01:19.650 --> 01:25.410
Creating the package, going through the same thing, create a few other.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.050
Called data.

01:34.820 --> 01:37.460
And this one called this model.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.520
This is going to be navigation.

01:54.890 --> 01:55.730
Network.

02:05.020 --> 02:06.280
Repository.

02:20.180 --> 02:24.890
Utils for utility classes or functions and so forth.

02:28.170 --> 02:34.230
And we're going to add components now, some of these we may not use, but it's always nice to have

02:34.230 --> 02:35.460
them in place if we need to.

02:35.490 --> 02:44.250
So and let's add another one called widgets, so we can add small pieces of code that represent a widget.

02:48.520 --> 02:48.870
OK.

02:49.010 --> 02:49.630
They're very good.

02:49.900 --> 02:59.020
And before I forget, let's also add another one called screens or screens such now because we are again

02:59.290 --> 03:07.060
looking to put a very strong structure using dagger and hilt for dependency injection, which facilitates

03:07.390 --> 03:09.190
our development in general.

03:10.330 --> 03:14.920
And this is also something that you should always keep in mind when developing Android apps.

03:15.070 --> 03:20.610
I understand that the setting up can be a little bit cumbersome or a little bit.

03:20.620 --> 03:27.820
It takes a little bit of time, but it's really worth the time to do this because it's easier to create

03:27.820 --> 03:33.970
applications that are easy to maintain, easy to extend as the complexity grows in her apps.

03:34.450 --> 03:38.710
So all this setting up, especially for I put it together, the dependency injection.

03:39.090 --> 03:40.900
It's it's really important.

03:40.930 --> 03:44.920
So that's how you should think about putting together your projects.

03:45.640 --> 03:45.880
Right.

03:45.880 --> 03:53.740
So in that spirit, I'm going to create a class at the main package level here, and I'm going to call

03:53.740 --> 03:55.720
this the weather application.

03:55.720 --> 04:01.360
So I'm going to say come and to create a new kind of in class, this is going to be just a simple class,

04:01.720 --> 04:01.970
OK?

04:02.410 --> 04:07.000
And I'm going to call this weather application OK.

04:07.450 --> 04:12.010
And because this weather application is going to be the one that ties everything together in terms of

04:12.310 --> 04:18.520
the dependency injection, so it will allow for this to be recognized overall, we'll have access to

04:18.520 --> 04:22.870
the top level class called the application class for Android.

04:22.930 --> 04:30.160
So I'm going to say make sure that make sure that I'm going to make sure that this inherits from application.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.370
You can see this is going to be application Android application.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.800
There is and like this?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.330
Well, OK.

04:37.990 --> 04:44.020
But now I need to make sure that this is also confirming to the hilt to make sure that this is a hilt

04:44.260 --> 04:46.870
dependency project in this case.

04:46.870 --> 04:51.580
And for point, I'm going to say at Helt Android like this.

04:51.670 --> 04:56.410
So this ties everything together to say, OK, we're creating this weather application class, which

04:56.890 --> 05:03.010
implements or in this case, inherits from application the Android application class, the class that

05:03.010 --> 05:07.180
knows everything about all the assets and everything, you know, project.

05:07.420 --> 05:13.540
We are also saying that we are going to make sure that this is not just any weather application class

05:13.540 --> 05:18.880
here, it's also a hilt Android app so that in the background, Hilda will know what to do to set everything

05:18.880 --> 05:25.660
up to make this application able to use the dependency injection and so forth.

05:26.710 --> 05:29.740
And that's all they're going to do for our weather application.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.210
What do we need to do next?

05:31.270 --> 05:38.950
Of course, is go to Maine and manifest, and we need to register this weather application right so

05:38.950 --> 05:45.910
that the entire project recognize it as the main class that needs to be propagated throughout the entire

05:46.120 --> 05:46.630
project.

05:47.170 --> 05:48.910
So for that, know we're here.

05:48.910 --> 05:55.390
If I start typing name like this enter and right away, you can see that Android Studio helps us to

05:55.390 --> 05:58.960
say, OK, you want to register this weather application here?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.190
You know my Android manifest.

06:00.550 --> 06:01.420
So we need to do that.

06:01.990 --> 06:02.330
OK.

06:02.350 --> 06:04.150
And while I'm here, let's go to our guy here.

06:04.150 --> 06:12.010
I'm going to add a new app module class here, and it's going to be an interface.

06:12.130 --> 06:19.510
I'm going to call this app module like this actually just a class, like a class like that, just app

06:19.510 --> 06:19.990
module.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.600
And we'll get back to that, but at least is there for now.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.300
And before we forget, let's go to our main activity.

06:26.380 --> 06:32.740
So in this class here, I'm going to say at Android entry point like this, this is for a dagger to

06:32.740 --> 06:39.880
know that this is the where we can actually start using and connecting all the dependencies that this

06:39.880 --> 06:42.190
application, this project may have.

06:42.310 --> 06:43.610
So we're just setting everything up.

06:43.630 --> 06:48.490
So we are able to use dependency injection for this and we'll see how all of that works.

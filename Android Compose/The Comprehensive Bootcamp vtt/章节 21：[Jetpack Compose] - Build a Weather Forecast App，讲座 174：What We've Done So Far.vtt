00:00.600 --> 00:07.140
So far, we've created this structure we needed, which is to have a splash screen, so if you run,

00:07.560 --> 00:11.640
we've put this structure where we have the animation for a nice animation there.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.030
And then after a few seconds, it goes to main screen, which is really, really good.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.380
That's exactly what we want.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.200
Now, before we move forward, I would like to restructure a few things here.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.850
First of all, there were screens here.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.670
I don't like to have all the screens inside of screens.

00:26.670 --> 00:34.440
So because later, as you will see, each screen may need to have its own classes, such as view models

00:34.440 --> 00:34.950
and so forth.

00:35.340 --> 00:42.510
So it's always important to divide of subdivided the screens into their own packages.

00:43.260 --> 00:43.860
What do you mean by that?

00:43.860 --> 00:46.710
Is as follows I'm going to right click here and add a new package.

00:48.240 --> 00:55.410
So let's say main, and then I'm going to take this main and add inside of main package there.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.140
And make sure that we factor everything.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.260
And then for our splash screen, I can do the same thing, right?

01:02.280 --> 01:04.650
So that creates yet another package.

01:08.150 --> 01:13.370
Called Splash that ad inside their.

01:15.080 --> 01:15.470
Forget.

01:17.330 --> 01:21.380
So it looks like we can change a few things inside of this.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.730
I would go I was necessary, but that works fine.

01:28.120 --> 01:28.450
OK.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.940
That's what we have so far.

01:31.980 --> 01:37.470
So far, we've put together our navigation, so we're able to put together the splash screen where animation

01:37.830 --> 01:44.040
and after a few seconds user were able to then, of course, go to the main screen, although the main

01:44.040 --> 01:46.160
screen doesn't look anything like What do you see there?

01:46.170 --> 01:47.140
But we're going to work on that.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.560
That's the beauty we're trying to put together.

01:49.830 --> 01:53.010
The infrastructure is slowly so we can see the whole picture.

01:53.640 --> 01:59.660
So that means now we are ready to look at putting together this infrastructure, which is the main screen

01:59.670 --> 01:59.940
now.

02:00.210 --> 02:03.780
There are a lot of things here, and so we will take our time.

02:04.680 --> 02:10.590
Most importantly, we are going to go and look at the data because the idea is to pass data from our

02:10.590 --> 02:11.430
weather API.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.920
And then make sure that your dad is waiting for the user interface.

02:16.040 --> 02:21.590
So that's very important because once we have the data, we know the data is is there for us to work

02:21.590 --> 02:27.230
with, then it's much easier to go and you look at the user interface, which is to put the user interface

02:27.230 --> 02:27.620
together.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.900
OK, so that's what we're going to be doing.

02:30.230 --> 02:38.180
We are going to go back to the back end and start focusing on retrieving data, using retrofit and other

02:38.180 --> 02:39.830
libraries along the way, of course.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.420
But that's what I'm going to be doing.

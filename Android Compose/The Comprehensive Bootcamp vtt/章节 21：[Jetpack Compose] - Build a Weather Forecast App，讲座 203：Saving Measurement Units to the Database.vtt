WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:06.540
So next, let's go ahead and add this pattern there for very simple, right where we finish.

00:09.930 --> 00:11.640
Let's see, have.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.920
Our column.

00:23.140 --> 00:26.830
Right to one side of our column here, let's create a button.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.510
And let's add a modifier.

00:53.880 --> 01:02.670
About three deep, and I'm going to align everything here, center horizontally or center horizontally

01:02.670 --> 01:03.180
like that.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.670
That's in no way another way of doing it or just importing, as you see at the top.

01:09.180 --> 01:11.970
We're importing this aligned companion central recently.

01:12.150 --> 01:13.050
OK, that's fine.

01:13.410 --> 01:19.740
Or if we don't like that idea, we can just do what we usually do, which is going to be alignment.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.630
Android compose central horizontally.

01:26.990 --> 01:27.330
Right?

01:27.350 --> 01:30.590
So but because that was important, we can just get rid of that.

01:31.070 --> 01:32.120
And this works as well.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.050
OK.

01:33.670 --> 01:35.720
Just different ways of doing the same thing, really.

01:36.110 --> 01:39.310
And let's put a shape or add a shape here.

01:39.320 --> 01:46.280
I want rounded corners, shape and 34 sort so really rounded.

01:50.230 --> 01:55.900
And I'm going to give colors and I'm going to change the button defaults, colors, right?

01:57.010 --> 02:04.900
So to do that, I'm going to use the button defaults, Android defaults, their say button colors.

02:05.350 --> 02:06.540
It always does this.

02:06.550 --> 02:10.220
He just goes and gets this whole package there.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.740
We don't want that.

02:16.420 --> 02:20.520
And then I'm going to say background color.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.230
Zero X.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.250
F e f b e for two.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.490
OK, and then so here I'm going to.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.320
Then add a text.

02:41.810 --> 02:44.120
They will just say save

02:48.050 --> 02:51.230
and let's go ahead and I want to fire.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.800
Padding around the deep.

03:05.950 --> 03:10.450
Given white collar of the text in this Al-Sadd of font size.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.220
Oh, about 17 SB.

03:18.570 --> 03:20.880
Bought that, I'm sure we could go ahead and run.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.420
Let's go to settings.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.800
All right, there you go, save, OK.

03:30.830 --> 03:35.000
That's where we get so Celsius Fahrenheit toggle button is working and everything.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.190
So now it's time for us to actually save something.

03:37.470 --> 03:42.570
Right now we have our Settings View model that we created earlier, so we haven't used that.

03:42.860 --> 03:43.160
OK.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.750
And this has the insert, update, delete, delete, all and so forth.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.950
Some of these I'm not we're not going to use, but it's always nice to have the full picture so you

03:51.950 --> 03:54.590
can see how all of this is put together.

03:54.920 --> 04:01.820
It's a very similar again from first, similar to what we did before for favorites, but I do it in

04:01.820 --> 04:03.170
a way so you can see.

04:03.740 --> 04:04.100
All right.

04:05.150 --> 04:09.190
So setting screen here where there's all of this happened.

04:09.350 --> 04:17.510
First of all, whenever we click on our save button, we have this on click or clickable event here

04:17.570 --> 04:18.650
or click event, it should say.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.170
So what is going to happen?

04:20.270 --> 04:21.860
First of all, we need to go and get.

04:22.910 --> 04:26.840
The settings of your model, right, and we have that passed along.

04:28.590 --> 04:34.740
Here so we have a Settings View model and is indeed a hit few model or hilt of your model, I should

04:34.740 --> 04:35.040
say.

04:36.180 --> 04:44.370
So what we want to do is because we're just changing back and forth one item or one field per say.

04:44.820 --> 04:50.580
Again, we're using databases because it's what we know so far and that's what we have at our disposal

04:50.580 --> 04:50.850
here.

04:51.090 --> 04:51.960
We're going to use that.

04:51.960 --> 04:57.660
But there are other infrastructure that we can use to say smaller pieces of data, such as data storage

04:57.660 --> 04:58.110
and so forth.

04:58.110 --> 04:59.280
But we're not going to get into that.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.190
We're going to just use their base, even though it may be a little bit of an overkill.

05:05.430 --> 05:05.970
That's fine.

05:06.520 --> 05:11.700
Right now, I'm going to say settings get the view model and then I'm going to.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.830
First of all, I'm going to do something very strange.

05:13.840 --> 05:19.050
I'm going to delete everything in our review model right to start because the idea what are we going

05:19.050 --> 05:27.090
to do is when we change this Celsius, or I should say this toggle button to change to Celsius, from

05:27.090 --> 05:28.740
Celsius to Fahrenheit and so forth.

05:29.490 --> 05:35.910
When we save what we want to do, want to delete the previous setting, they may have had added or saved

05:36.600 --> 05:42.390
to save this new one because in our database, our table just want allowed to have one setting at a

05:42.400 --> 05:42.630
time.

05:42.630 --> 05:43.290
That makes sense.

05:43.770 --> 05:48.180
This is just a way that a feature will be easier to put this together.

05:49.350 --> 05:54.070
So I'm going to delete everything I'm going to before anything, and then I'm going to call settings

05:54.070 --> 05:58.170
if you want again and I'm going to say insert unit, right?

05:59.260 --> 06:05.560
And then I'm create a unit, make sure we create a unit object that's ours and that unit cuddling,

06:05.560 --> 06:06.730
that's a totally different thing.

06:07.090 --> 06:07.350
All right.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.310
So we want the model.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.130
We don't want this other one either.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.730
So the model and then I'm going to create that unit.

06:13.750 --> 06:19.900
So first of all, we need to ask the unit property and where do we get that unit property?

06:19.900 --> 06:24.520
Will that unit property is going to be the choice state here?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.470
Looks like we have a little problem.

06:28.120 --> 06:28.780
OK, there we go.

06:29.290 --> 06:35.920
So the choice is going to be the state that we created, which will contain either imperial or metric.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.510
So that also is going to be happening as we click right Celsius or metric or, in this case, Celsius

06:43.510 --> 06:44.350
or Fahrenheit.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.910
So as we click, we're changing this state, which will at some point or at any point in time, will

06:50.910 --> 06:53.580
have either have imperial or metric.

06:54.820 --> 06:59.650
So we're going to use that right to pass on to our database, because that is what it's going to have

06:59.950 --> 07:02.920
the most current state of our choice.

07:03.490 --> 07:09.640
So it's a choice state like that and believe it or not, that's it.

07:10.600 --> 07:16.330
So now I'm going to say this, and let's run this one thing I want to show you here is that in Android

07:16.330 --> 07:20.610
Studio, you can actually see your database schema as you database tables and so forth.

07:20.620 --> 07:23.830
To do so, you will have to go to app inspection.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.110
And if you don't see this, tap here, it's very simple.

07:26.500 --> 07:35.450
All you do is is you go at the top where says view and you go to tool windows and click on app inspection.

07:35.470 --> 07:38.660
I'm not going to click right now because I already have it, so click.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.530
App inspection and you should have at the bottom of this app inspection.

07:42.130 --> 07:48.160
Now, when you click on that, we'll take you a little bit, by the way, and then you will see that

07:48.160 --> 07:51.970
we have this database where they're going to base and see my fave table.

07:52.390 --> 07:53.550
And this is the master table.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.590
We don't need to look into that, but we need to look at the settings.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.270
Let's click on Settings.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.610
Let's double click to actually see everything.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.970
Notice Settings doesn't have anything yet, right?

08:04.120 --> 08:07.450
But if we go to favorites Typekit, you can see Favorites San Diego.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.430
At this point, that's all we have in our favorites.

08:09.450 --> 08:12.790
In fact, if you go to look a favorites, we should see San Diego.

08:13.720 --> 08:20.950
If I add just a side note here, let's say Seattle again, that's added.

08:21.430 --> 08:26.740
Actually, that added, I'm going to add now, and if you go here, obviously you can see we have Seattle.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.680
And if you refresh, you should see Seattle there.

08:29.890 --> 08:35.860
So this is a really good tool to see how the base tables and everything, how things are being saved,

08:35.920 --> 08:37.420
how what we have in there.

08:37.810 --> 08:38.440
So are settings.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.360
If you double click to notice has nothing now.

08:40.840 --> 08:45.010
So let's go ahead and save a state or a unit, I should say.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.360
Let's go to settings.

08:47.210 --> 08:51.250
I'm going to go to save Celsius saved.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.050
Go ahead and run this once again.

08:53.920 --> 09:00.970
Go and save like this should delete everything and save Celsius, which is metrics.

09:01.630 --> 09:02.000
All right.

09:02.020 --> 09:02.680
So it's working.

00:00.210 --> 00:03.080
So we've added our Firebase dependencies.

00:03.420 --> 00:08.820
Now there are few other dependencies I would like to add here because we'll need them.

00:09.540 --> 00:12.830
So let's start by going to the top here.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.190
So we have our plug ins.

00:14.190 --> 00:16.290
I'm going to add a couple more plug ins here.

00:16.680 --> 00:22.310
So now I have this Caitlin capped like Ian and also dagger hilt Android plugin.

00:22.320 --> 00:28.080
So we're going to need these because we're going to be using Helt as our dependency injector.

00:28.740 --> 00:29.040
OK.

00:30.210 --> 00:33.480
So for this to work, of course, I have to add a few other things.

00:34.020 --> 00:40.590
So at the bottom and our dependencies, a few other plug ins, I'm going to add here a few other dependencies.

00:40.590 --> 00:46.220
I'm going to add copying now instead of you trying to pause this video and go and type all of this.

00:46.230 --> 00:47.910
That's just not good use of your time.

00:48.270 --> 00:55.470
What you can do is go to my repo, which you have access to where we have this project and go and find

00:55.470 --> 00:57.210
the build that Gradle that app.

00:57.340 --> 00:57.680
OK.

00:57.870 --> 01:02.970
And look at the build that Gradle, that app and to build it, that Gradle module.

01:03.450 --> 01:09.240
And so you see all of the dependencies and plugins that I've added, that's probably going to be the

01:09.240 --> 01:11.340
best and make sure you have exactly what I have.

01:11.640 --> 01:17.490
Of course, like I say, you can change or you may need to change the versioning, but that's my dad's

01:17.520 --> 01:20.310
still the same because we need all of these dependencies.

01:20.550 --> 01:25.140
OK, so I'm also going to create this hilt a version inside of our.

01:27.160 --> 01:35.530
Bill, that Gradle module one top level and it passed like this, and I believe way at this point is

01:35.530 --> 01:43.000
going to be to that 39 again, this may change, so that's fine.

01:43.420 --> 01:49.650
And I also need to add this class path, which is Google Dagger Hilt Gradle plugin.

01:49.690 --> 01:54.670
I such and you can see the numbers should be the same with the health version.

01:56.270 --> 01:56.600
All right.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.650
So this is very important to add, so we have those dependencies, let's go ahead and sync.

02:01.100 --> 02:01.450
All right.

02:01.470 --> 02:03.750
Let's go back to build a grade on that app.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.570
There are a few other things I'm going to add here.

02:05.630 --> 02:11.840
Yes, I know a lot of things, and that's why I'm saying you probably will be better off to go to get

02:11.840 --> 02:16.280
this file in the repo for this app.

02:16.610 --> 02:16.880
OK.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.320
And you have access to that.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.050
OK, so what else am I going to add?

02:22.100 --> 02:25.670
I'm going to add a few core routines dependencies here.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.030
And there's another one.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.200
Couple more.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.280
The bottom there.

02:31.520 --> 02:38.180
And because we're going to deal with getting images, I'm going to also add the coil dependency, which

02:38.180 --> 02:40.520
is the library that we're going to be using to.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.450
Get images from the internet and show them in our app.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.070
OK, let's go ahead and sink it all.

02:47.610 --> 02:50.040
Everything seems to be fine.

02:50.160 --> 02:50.760
That's well, good.

02:51.270 --> 02:54.570
Let's go ahead and run one more time to make sure that I didn't miss anything.

02:55.950 --> 02:57.690
All right, so now everything OK.

02:57.720 --> 03:02.820
So I still see Hello Android from our project because we haven't done anything in our user interface,

03:02.820 --> 03:03.330
so that's good.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.410
This is always good news.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.570
Again, while we here.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.790
Yes, I know a lot of things, but it's OK.

03:08.820 --> 03:09.900
We're used to this now.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.240
We're going to go to our manifest here.

03:12.250 --> 03:16.980
So I'm going to add the permissions here because this is one of these things that we always forget.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.210
This is Will.

03:18.300 --> 03:23.340
This will allow us to be able to use internet in our application, which we need.

03:23.550 --> 03:23.970
Of course.

03:24.450 --> 03:29.070
So just add that one there and I wish would be good.

03:31.020 --> 03:31.330
All right.

03:31.350 --> 03:32.670
Let's get rid of all of those.

03:33.420 --> 03:38.880
And at this point, we should be ready to get started and if there's anything else we need to add,

03:38.880 --> 03:42.260
of course we're going to be adding those as we go through the course.

03:42.330 --> 03:46.320
So but at least make sure you have these bases done right.

03:46.620 --> 03:51.930
But at least make sure that we have the setup done, especially the Firebase set up done, because that

03:51.930 --> 03:54.450
is crucial for our application.

03:54.570 --> 03:57.090
So, all right, I'll see you next.

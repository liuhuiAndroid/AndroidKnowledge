00:01.170 --> 00:03.160
Let's see if we can add an image here.

00:03.570 --> 00:11.540
Because remember, we have that set up in our inside of this card white card, we have the image there

00:11.550 --> 00:13.290
paint or we are using Croyle.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.330
Remember image paint or to allow us to get images from the internet.

00:17.400 --> 00:17.670
Right?

00:19.590 --> 00:25.890
So later, you will see that you get it, will get images and we'll get books from this API, Google

00:25.890 --> 00:27.060
APIs dot com.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.030
This allows us to pass in a query.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.660
For instance, Android will get all the books, Android books and so forth.

00:33.660 --> 00:39.030
So and we'll get these images, of course, metadata from these API.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.890
So I'm going to get a link here of a thumbnail of this image that's copied this.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.240
Let's see if I can do this.

00:46.410 --> 00:50.370
Let's copy that, and let's paste it all in in here.

00:50.400 --> 00:56.160
OK, so this is the API image that we're going to be using later, but I'm just hard coding it so we

00:56.160 --> 00:58.410
can see, hopefully an image here.

00:58.540 --> 01:03.420
Obviously, we'll have to actually run on device in order for us to see this.

01:03.870 --> 01:04.530
So let's see.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.560
OK, there you go.

01:09.210 --> 01:09.840
It's working.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.690
You can see we have the nice image there.

01:13.290 --> 01:22.110
Now if in case you don't see this image loading because if you look at this one, if I right click and

01:22.110 --> 01:31.440
open in a new tab, you'll see that this is not a secure place, which means Android Studio may not

01:31.440 --> 01:36.040
like that to run links that are not secure to get images.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.960
So if you find that problem something, you don't see the actual image there.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.420
What do you need to do is you need to go to manifest file.

01:46.260 --> 01:49.230
And here you just have to start typing something like this.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.900
And you're going to see this uses clear text traffic.

01:55.530 --> 01:55.830
OK.

01:56.160 --> 02:01.560
So what these days, as you see here, it says, declare that this application may use clear text traffic,

02:01.560 --> 02:04.380
such as a strip rather than a steps.

02:04.860 --> 02:05.190
OK.

02:05.610 --> 02:09.420
It's going to allow us to use unsafe links.

02:09.450 --> 02:15.150
Now, of course, it's kind of debatable whether you want to allow your app to do this, but in this

02:15.150 --> 02:16.320
case, it's OK.

02:16.350 --> 02:20.040
We're going to say true, it's OK because we know exactly where these links are coming from.

02:20.050 --> 02:21.960
It's Google, so it's OK.

02:22.170 --> 02:22.530
All right.

02:23.440 --> 02:28.540
So that's one case that you don't end up seeing an image showing here.

02:29.350 --> 02:36.640
And of course, you can test out with any image link image from the internet and then check if you're

02:36.640 --> 02:37.900
going to be able to see that image.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.260
All right.

02:38.260 --> 02:40.510
So in this case, here again, let's go ahead and refresh.

02:41.590 --> 02:43.510
We should be able to still see that image there.

02:43.690 --> 02:49.660
So that gives us the full picture of how this car Liscard would look like.

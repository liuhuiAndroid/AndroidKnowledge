00:00.330 --> 00:02.670
Let's start with calculating the total tip.

00:03.180 --> 00:10.110
Well, to calculate the total tip, first of all, we will need the Enter Bill White, the amount of

00:10.110 --> 00:18.060
the bill, and we need to multiply that by the percentage of the tip that the user wants to give.

00:18.270 --> 00:23.770
That means all of that will have to be driven inside of our own value changed set of a slider because

00:23.770 --> 00:30.870
the idea is once something is entered to say 100, so we will always have one for this split by state.

00:31.530 --> 00:36.810
And so the driving method here, the driving mechanism, if you will, is going to be the slider.

00:36.810 --> 00:43.470
So we are going to dynamically as the slider slides left or right or increasing the percentage we want

00:43.470 --> 00:43.840
to give.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.940
We're going to also calculate the tip amount.

00:48.150 --> 00:53.700
So inside of our slider here, this is where we are going to say something like this.

00:53.710 --> 00:59.700
First of all, we need to create a state that's going to say tip amount, state that value.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.500
Notice we haven't created this yet.

01:01.560 --> 01:02.820
It's going to be equal to.

01:03.330 --> 01:08.010
Well, it's going to be equal to a function that will calculate the total tips.

01:08.020 --> 01:11.910
I'm going to say calculate total tip.

01:12.990 --> 01:17.920
Which will require us to pass a total bill that value.

01:18.090 --> 01:22.650
And the tip percentage tip percentage like this.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.860
OK, so let's go ahead and create for the tip amount.

01:26.070 --> 01:29.790
So going up again, still inside of our function here.

01:29.920 --> 01:38.160
Foul tip amount state to remember the total state of and it's going to be a double because that's what

01:38.160 --> 01:38.970
we're going to be expecting.

01:38.980 --> 01:44.790
So 0.0 to start with going down here, we still have to create this calculate total tip.

01:45.180 --> 01:51.050
So what we can do here can actually go click right there and say create function, calculate total tip.

01:51.660 --> 01:54.420
And you can see it's created at the bottom here.

01:54.510 --> 01:59.050
And before we do that, let's set a same value for the arguments named argument here.

01:59.060 --> 02:05.580
And let's say total bill instead of string, let's say double, because that's what we need.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.820
We have to transform that into double A. percentage.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.040
It's fine as an entity.

02:11.640 --> 02:11.880
All right.

02:11.880 --> 02:18.360
So here I'm going to say return, and I'm going to check in and say if total bill amount is greater

02:18.360 --> 02:22.530
than one because we don't want to start looking to calculate it.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.640
His calculator total tip if total bill is not greater than one.

02:26.730 --> 02:31.890
And in this case, it's a total bill not to string.

02:32.790 --> 02:37.470
I just want to make sure that it is not empty such.

02:38.860 --> 02:44.680
If that's the case, I'm going to put a new line, let's say, total bill, in this case, I'm going

02:44.680 --> 02:50.980
to multiply this by tip percentage and let's divide that by 100.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.990
So we get the right value.

02:53.470 --> 02:57.480
And let's say else, you know the case, I'm just going to return 0.2 zero.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.900
So what we're saying here, we're going to calculate total bill only after the bill is greater than

03:01.900 --> 03:08.950
one and total bill is not empty and then get that total bill by about two percentage, which we're going

03:08.950 --> 03:11.350
to be passing there and we divide that by 100.

03:11.470 --> 03:16.860
In no case, we're just going to say return zero, that zero in any other case, we're just going to

03:16.860 --> 03:20.890
return 0.0 because remember expects to return it double.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.050
OK, let's go where we are calling this.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.350
And of course, we're going to have some issues here.

03:25.360 --> 03:31.570
First of all, let's go ahead and just add the named parameters here just to make it more clear to total

03:31.930 --> 03:38.800
that and this is going to be a percentage or two percent is equal to that.

03:39.090 --> 03:42.190
OK, this is good to see that we know exactly what we're passing.

03:42.460 --> 03:46.930
Either way would have worked, but named parameters or arguments are really good.

03:47.410 --> 03:47.650
All right.

03:47.650 --> 03:50.590
So we have an issue here because we need in fact to have over.

03:50.590 --> 03:55.020
It's going to say change parameter or build type function to return a string.

03:55.030 --> 04:00.490
What we want actually is to make this say not to double because that's what we the value that we want

04:00.910 --> 04:01.870
it to Typekit anyway.

04:02.050 --> 04:07.210
So now we have our tip amount, which is going to be this string here.

04:07.330 --> 04:14.680
It should be changing accordingly as we slide left or right or increase or decrease our tip percentage.

04:15.190 --> 04:16.810
Where is this going to be called?

04:16.810 --> 04:17.740
We've got up here.

04:17.770 --> 04:19.270
We can see it's going to be called here.

04:19.270 --> 04:21.940
This is where our tip amount should be called.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.730
So let's go ahead and get rid of that.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.820
And I give space, say tip amount.

04:31.940 --> 04:34.130
State get that value.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.310
Let's see if this is true.

04:37.340 --> 04:38.180
Let's go ahead and run.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.600
OK, there it is.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.290
And of course, we're going to have to enter, let's say, 100.

04:50.380 --> 04:51.250
It's a nice number.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.480
And then let's see if this works.

04:53.500 --> 04:58.780
So as you start increasing the file, you can see there are two or three two percent.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.360
The total tip is going to be $30, right?

05:02.440 --> 05:02.830
Very good.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.210
So this is indeed working.

05:04.210 --> 05:07.770
If I go to zero, I can see, well, there's no tip.

05:07.810 --> 05:11.740
So there is zero dollars that we need to add for our tip.

05:12.250 --> 05:12.590
OK.

05:12.610 --> 05:13.240
Very simple.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.830
Now one thing we can do, of course, because things are getting a little bit chaotic and that we have

05:17.830 --> 05:21.640
all our code inside of main activity and this is not a good thing.

05:22.330 --> 05:29.290
And so what do we need to do is let's go back to a project and I'm going to create yet another package.

05:29.650 --> 05:34.330
So new package packages called this utils or you tail like this?

05:34.690 --> 05:37.300
And inside here, I'm going to create a.

05:39.030 --> 05:41.370
File cut in class or file.

05:42.180 --> 05:43.370
I'm going to call this util.

05:44.580 --> 05:48.060
OK, so here I'm just going to go ahead and get that function.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.600
This calculator function and because these functions are treated.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.370
And I'm going to add there.

05:57.650 --> 06:01.490
And going back to Maine, I'm going to have some issues, I'm going to click here.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.440
It's going to say I don't know what to calculate.

06:03.500 --> 06:09.140
The total tip is that means we need to import so alt or option, enter whichever way you want.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.880
And voila, now things are good.

06:11.150 --> 06:13.910
So we have a factor, a little bit of our code.

06:14.570 --> 06:14.960
All right.

06:14.990 --> 06:15.500
There it is.

06:16.530 --> 06:19.190
We are now able to calculate our tip.

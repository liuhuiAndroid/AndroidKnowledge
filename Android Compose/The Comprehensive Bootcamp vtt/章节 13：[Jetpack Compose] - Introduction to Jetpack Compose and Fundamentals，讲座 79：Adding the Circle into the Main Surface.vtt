00:00.360 --> 00:05.010
Nice, so we're able to put tap in the middle of our card, which in this case is a circle.

00:06.030 --> 00:11.070
Now we want to make sure that this tap here or actually this whole card when it's tapped or clicked,

00:11.640 --> 00:16.050
something happens to want to make this whole composable, this whole widget here clickable.

00:16.230 --> 00:16.890
How do we do that?

00:17.130 --> 00:18.450
Because remember, this is just a card.

00:18.450 --> 00:23.970
If you have over, you see, there's no on click event that we can pass directly.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.710
But here's the thing.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.180
Because of modifier, we can actually invoke a clickable event.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.400
Look at this.

00:31.410 --> 00:35.490
If I say dot clickable, I can make anything clickable.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.540
If I hit, enter can see now we have another trailing lineberger.

00:39.810 --> 00:44.040
Here is where we actually add the event.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.770
Here is where we captured the clickable event.

00:49.580 --> 00:57.500
In fact, if I just come here and I want to log out just for testing purposes, I can say Log D can

00:57.500 --> 00:59.970
see you have an option of creating a lock and enter.

01:00.030 --> 01:02.000
Then there is this code completion.

01:02.630 --> 01:11.000
So for a logged four log debug, we need to pass here a tag and say, tap like this circle a sandwiches

01:11.000 --> 01:12.200
circle, tap like that.

01:12.590 --> 01:15.380
So now if we run this, we should be able to.

01:15.380 --> 01:21.290
When this whole entity, this whole widget is tapped, we should get this message.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.200
We can also deploy this specific preview here.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.320
Own to device by clicking this button there.

01:26.330 --> 01:28.700
So right click there, actually.

01:33.270 --> 01:36.300
Let's look at her emulator, and we should see, hopefully soon.

01:38.180 --> 01:41.230
Something let's go ahead and just good code so we can save some space.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.940
They would go it's very small, can make it this little bit bigger, so you can actually see they're

01:49.940 --> 01:50.960
very small, but there it is.

01:51.230 --> 01:52.460
Now let's see if this works.

01:52.460 --> 01:57.450
I'm going to open LOLCat and I put tap here for Orange Rejects.

01:58.190 --> 02:01.250
So if you tap, you can see says tap there.

02:04.050 --> 02:05.820
So each time it tap, it's going to show.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.430
You can see all of the taps are being shown there.

02:13.180 --> 02:14.080
All right, so it's working.

02:14.440 --> 02:19.240
All we had to do is just to through our modifier to say we want this car to be clickable.

02:19.510 --> 02:25.320
And when that happens, we want, in this case, a message that says Create Circle Tap, which is exactly

02:25.320 --> 02:25.810
what you see.

02:27.340 --> 02:29.770
OK, so as you can see, when we run it, it's really small.

02:29.770 --> 02:30.730
Want to make a little bit bigger?

02:31.030 --> 02:34.600
Let's maybe make this one hundred and five.

02:35.080 --> 02:35.590
There we go.

02:35.920 --> 02:36.880
It's really large.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.920
The other thing we can do because it's a card, if you have over again, you see we have this elevation.

02:41.920 --> 02:48.370
So this elevation, what it will do will elevate the button so that we have a contrast between the button

02:48.370 --> 02:49.090
and the background.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.390
Because as you see here right now, it's very minimal the contrast.

02:52.630 --> 02:56.200
So hover over it to make sure we know exactly where that.

02:56.680 --> 03:00.640
So any time after our shape, we can add elevation.

03:00.720 --> 03:06.180
So we have modifier there and we have shape.

03:06.190 --> 03:09.370
I'm going to just put here the what I'm going to say elevation.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.050
And give it a bath for that deep like this.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.230
All right.

03:19.300 --> 03:19.930
Let's go ahead.

03:26.230 --> 03:34.650
We can stop this if we want it and go back to split mode and make this that size in the sky and refresh,

03:34.660 --> 03:36.640
we should see some differences there.

03:40.100 --> 03:46.060
Right there it is, it's hard to see us go ahead and just run altogether on an animal later, hopefully

03:46.060 --> 03:46.630
we can see.

03:48.970 --> 03:49.450
Aha!

03:49.780 --> 03:51.880
Now you may ask, OK, what's going on here?

03:51.910 --> 03:54.000
Why is that we don't see anything on Amelia.

03:54.010 --> 04:01.750
Remember earlier we actually created or clicked the blog preview, which just deployed this not necessarily

04:01.750 --> 04:02.200
the app.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.030
So that is a distinction.

04:04.210 --> 04:10.240
Another thing here you remember that we still constructing our circle here and we have in a preview

04:10.240 --> 04:12.100
mode for this create circle.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.600
We're not calling it anywhere.

04:14.140 --> 04:20.890
So if I call it inside of my app because my or my app is being called inside of us, that content that

04:20.890 --> 04:21.370
should work.

04:21.700 --> 04:25.540
So here I'm going to say, create a circle like that.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.510
Now, if I run, I should be able to see that circle.

04:30.520 --> 04:30.790
Huh.

04:31.450 --> 04:31.960
There we go.

04:32.050 --> 04:38.200
There is our circle, the circle is not what we're expecting, but it's OK, we'll fix that.

04:38.380 --> 04:44.590
So what's happening here is that because in our my app here, we have a surface and we are saying fill

04:44.590 --> 04:47.470
max height and fill max width.

04:47.770 --> 04:52.750
So the circle now is taking up the entire space where there's nothing else inside of this surface.

04:52.930 --> 04:53.560
We'll fix that.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.320
But nonetheless, you can see now that there is a distinction between the background and the button

04:59.320 --> 05:01.120
because we added that elevation.

05:03.460 --> 05:07.120
Here, so the bigger the elevation, the more contrast you will have.

05:07.450 --> 05:07.750
OK?

05:07.960 --> 05:09.040
Can see at the bottom here.

05:09.130 --> 05:10.210
Actually, it's probably better.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.400
There's some sort of shadow happening there.

05:13.710 --> 05:19.460
OK, now if you click, you can see how this will work, if you go back to LOLCat, can see that Tap

05:19.470 --> 05:22.110
has been working each time you tap, everything still works.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.820
All right, so next, we need to tackle this problem we're having here, which is it's taking up the

05:26.820 --> 05:30.390
whole space, which is exactly what we told the surface to do.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.280
But that's not what we want.

05:32.620 --> 05:35.460
Want the button to hopefully be in the middle of the screen.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.620
So I want you to think about this.

05:37.980 --> 05:44.220
What would be a way for us to make it so that this button is in the middle of the screen?

00:00.330 --> 00:07.080
So one thing I noticed this is after I was testing out things I noticed when we have a book, let's

00:07.080 --> 00:13.380
go ahead and I'm going to change this rating here, even though an update this is for it still sees

00:13.380 --> 00:17.550
3.5 here, it looks like I'm not changing this book rating at all.

00:18.090 --> 00:20.430
So let's start looking at.

00:21.720 --> 00:27.270
Let's go to our list card looks like the book reading is there and it's always using that.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.640
What do we want to do instead?

00:29.850 --> 00:31.950
Is pass the book right?

00:33.210 --> 00:34.770
And so we're going to go to the book.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.380
This is something I forgot.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.860
It's a book that rating.

00:41.870 --> 00:45.290
I guess so now let's go ahead and run.

00:49.100 --> 00:56.540
Now you can see it says four, because that's exactly what we have, if I say to which we should see

00:56.540 --> 00:57.170
two there.

00:57.440 --> 01:02.960
And let's make sure that it works all across, say, started reading and update now say zero.

01:03.080 --> 01:03.970
OK, that's okay.

01:04.070 --> 01:04.490
Click.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.380
Once we start reading, it refreshes everything.

01:07.400 --> 01:07.990
Let's update.

01:08.850 --> 01:09.520
OK, very good.

01:09.620 --> 01:12.560
So it is indeed working, as we would expect.

01:13.550 --> 01:13.860
All right.

01:13.880 --> 01:14.930
That was just a little thing.

01:15.260 --> 01:20.360
Make sure you go to a book rating in our components or wherever you created that and pass the actual

01:20.360 --> 01:23.350
book value there, right?

01:23.570 --> 01:24.230
Book that rating.

WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:05.630
All right, so continue here in sort of our common text field, which we created the bottom here, but

00:05.640 --> 00:08.700
it's being called inside of our search bar.

00:10.470 --> 00:18.480
On action here, meaning when we are when users types search and come here and they want to add something,

00:18.870 --> 00:24.930
the keyboard will show up right and at the bottom, we will have this next or arrow button there.

00:24.930 --> 00:29.880
So that means that when they click that we want to validate and do what needs to be done in order to

00:29.880 --> 00:31.020
take this information.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.520
In this case, the city name, they have just entered and do something with it.

00:35.930 --> 00:42.330
So this is all captured here in the keyboard actions, meaning what action they have done after they've

00:42.780 --> 00:44.580
right, after they've added something.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.160
We want to capture that and move forward.

00:47.850 --> 00:50.250
OK, so here is where I'm going to do something like this.

00:50.250 --> 00:56.430
I'm going to say if because I want to validate or check if whatever was entered is valid, if it's not

00:56.430 --> 00:57.810
in this, it's not valid.

00:57.810 --> 01:03.870
And I can do that because remember, I have this remember variable that created there, which validates

01:03.870 --> 01:06.830
really returns, whether it's true or false.

01:06.840 --> 01:13.110
If we have if the search query doesn't have anything right and this is not what I want to let me, I

01:13.110 --> 01:14.670
don't know what what happened there.

01:15.330 --> 01:18.300
Let's say Dot.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.530
He's empty.

01:31.710 --> 01:33.150
This shouldn't be inside.

01:33.210 --> 01:37.500
That's why it's OK, let me move all of that.

01:41.990 --> 01:45.860
Putin said of a lambada and pacing like this.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.350
Let's say is not.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.250
Empty like that.

02:02.930 --> 02:03.280
OK.

02:03.380 --> 02:04.100
That sort of want.

02:04.580 --> 02:09.830
All right, so back here, if it's not valid, meaning it's empty in this case, I'm just going to return.

02:10.770 --> 02:11.250
Like this?

02:11.640 --> 02:17.790
So this case us, we turn nothing into the case, which means that it's validated, then I'm going to

02:17.790 --> 02:23.160
invoke the on search, right, which is what we passing here, right?

02:23.430 --> 02:29.820
And we're going to pass a string that was going to be coming from our text field, pass that along.

02:30.660 --> 02:38.040
So when I pass the search query state value, of course, I'm going to trim it so that we don't have

02:38.040 --> 02:39.540
excess of things that we don't want.

02:40.020 --> 02:40.350
All right.

02:40.920 --> 02:45.840
And then once that happened, I'm going to just use it and search for state and value just to clear

02:45.840 --> 02:46.390
everything up.

02:46.410 --> 02:48.780
I'm just going to put an empty string like that.

02:48.780 --> 02:53.940
So what that means once we click that next to enter or whatever, you know, our keyboard, we're going

02:53.940 --> 02:55.500
to clear our text field.

02:56.850 --> 02:57.780
That's what we're doing there.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.160
And once that is done, we want to make sure there are keyboard controller.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.330
Look at that.

03:03.930 --> 03:11.430
And I'm going to say hide so we can hide our keyboard controller, which means I need to safeguard it

03:11.430 --> 03:13.260
with the exclamation point like that.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.110
And that's it.

03:16.010 --> 03:21.440
And I do realize that we took a long time, and I do realize that we took a long time to put this together,

03:21.440 --> 03:28.460
but it's important to do this way and not trying to do the other way because number one, we have these

03:28.460 --> 03:30.320
capability of reusing this code.

03:30.530 --> 03:31.700
We're using this composable.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.230
And number two.

03:34.290 --> 03:41.010
It just makes it much easier to extend our search bar if we want to add, for instance, in this column

03:41.010 --> 03:41.290
here.

03:41.310 --> 03:43.950
Another common text we can add as many as we want.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.110
So think in those terms?

03:46.170 --> 03:48.010
Always very good.

03:48.270 --> 03:52.650
So now we have a search bar fairly ready to be used.

03:53.050 --> 03:59.070
OK, so I'm going to call this inside of our search screen, which is going to be here.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.090
All right.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.110
Inside of this column, I say search bar.

04:06.030 --> 04:08.220
I see Search Bar.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.450
There we go.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.390
And then I'm going to pass a few things, let's make sure that we don't have a different search bar,

04:16.660 --> 04:22.430
right, because we are using the experimental experimental composer UI.

04:22.450 --> 04:28.300
We also have to annotate that whatever it's calling it, let's pass a modifier here.

04:29.580 --> 04:36.150
Actually, before we do that, that means we have to allow this to have a modifier that makes sense.

04:36.900 --> 04:42.900
And I'm just going to say modifier like this as a default one.

04:44.100 --> 04:44.700
Very well.

04:45.270 --> 04:48.000
So now I'm going to be able to pass that modifier.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.870
Said, I feel Max width

04:59.630 --> 05:03.980
and I'm going to give a padding of about 16 dpi all along.

05:05.420 --> 05:13.070
And I want to align everything by saying alignment, compose alignment.

05:13.070 --> 05:17.930
Of course, I want this to be center horizontally like that.

05:18.590 --> 05:18.950
Very good.

05:19.340 --> 05:21.800
Now the beauty also because is a search bar.

05:21.810 --> 05:28.310
And remember, because we have these on search and is the last parameter and it's a function of our

05:28.310 --> 05:28.730
search bar.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.380
It means we can use, yes, you guessed it, we can use a lambda trailing lambda.

05:33.410 --> 05:33.920
That's the beauty.

05:33.930 --> 05:39.920
And if you do that, it can see we now have this it implicit variable that is passed around, which

05:39.920 --> 05:46.640
in this case is going to be whatever is inside of our text field because we're passing it along, right?

05:47.150 --> 05:48.380
So have a search here.

05:48.380 --> 05:52.550
When we call it here, we're passing our query value.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.340
OK, so we can use that, we can do whatever we want.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.310
So let's go back to where I'm calling.

05:58.340 --> 05:58.970
There we go here.

05:59.570 --> 06:07.160
Let's say logged for now, and I'm just going to pass this idea like this, which is going to be like

06:07.160 --> 06:08.780
I said, whatever users have entered.

06:10.070 --> 06:10.490
All right.

06:10.890 --> 06:13.040
OK, let's see if this is going to work this.

06:13.310 --> 06:14.150
That's the whole point.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.410
Let's run this.

06:17.520 --> 06:17.970
All right.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.220
Let's click Aha!

06:20.250 --> 06:23.130
Look, how beautiful this looks, great, wonderful.

06:23.340 --> 06:23.610
All right.

06:23.790 --> 06:28.800
Instead of Seattle, let's say San Diego, my wife's favorite place ever.

06:29.610 --> 06:31.320
Let's go and say, enter.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.240
OK, it's clear.

06:33.240 --> 06:38.220
Now let's go to our Logcat and San Diego is showing they're beautiful.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.470
This is exactly what we need.

06:39.930 --> 06:48.360
Remember, the idea is as follows when we hit enter or next year, our keyboard, we want to be taken

06:48.360 --> 06:50.430
back to our main screen.

06:50.970 --> 06:51.900
You can go like this.

06:53.490 --> 06:54.330
Try again.

06:54.570 --> 07:00.840
Main screen like this and we are going to get, for instance, San Diego what users have entered, and

07:00.840 --> 07:04.530
we're going to repopulate this entire main view with the new city.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.060
That is the idea.

07:06.510 --> 07:11.340
But one thing at a time we were able to pass along or get that information.

07:12.700 --> 07:18.760
In our search, which is good, and now we are going to be able to then take that information.

07:18.850 --> 07:22.580
In this case, the city name and pass it along back to our main screen.

07:23.290 --> 07:24.250
Now how do we do that?

07:24.280 --> 07:32.070
How do we then get this city name from our search back to a main screen, whether navigation lights?

07:32.330 --> 07:40.780
So it looks like we have an issue here or not sure why outright we have to add experimental even here.

07:40.810 --> 07:41.440
Let's do that.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.090
OK, because we using that experimental API, we have to.

07:46.270 --> 07:47.230
Anywhere we call it.

07:47.350 --> 07:52.150
This also has to be called or added right to the the annotation.

07:52.660 --> 08:00.490
Now we have to change the way we have set up our main screen because the idea again, is to get that

08:00.610 --> 08:07.210
data, the city that was added and go back to our main screen and repopulate the main screen with the

08:07.210 --> 08:08.560
new data with the new CD.

08:09.730 --> 08:13.450
So in this case, here we need to pass the variable.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.870
We need to pass a data through our composable.

08:17.620 --> 08:17.880
Right?

08:18.850 --> 08:25.870
And in this case, with our navigation, so to do that, it's it's fairly simple, but we have to restructure

08:25.870 --> 08:26.440
a few things.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.200
So back to our weather navigation here.

08:32.060 --> 08:37.970
In our composable where we have this main screen, what I'm going to do, I'm going to get it out of

08:37.970 --> 08:38.240
there.

08:38.240 --> 08:46.580
So when, say, Val route or I want to say whether screen screams I see as you see there and I'm going

08:46.580 --> 08:48.470
to say main screen that name.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.800
So essentially, I'm going to remove this.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.780
I removed is and put it there.

08:53.810 --> 08:56.750
So now I'm going to call this out like this same thing.

08:56.750 --> 08:57.290
Nothing new.

08:57.530 --> 09:06.980
But what's not new or what is new, I should say, is that now I'm going to put that inside of double

09:06.980 --> 09:11.420
quotes to say it is a string because I want to append something else.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.930
So I'm going to say dollar sign to have the variable.

09:15.290 --> 09:19.160
And then I'm going to say forward slash and curly braces as such.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.940
And inside I'm going to pass the city variable like this.

09:23.930 --> 09:33.380
What that means is as follow when we call this route here, this main screen we're going to have, just

09:33.380 --> 09:35.850
like we have on the web, right?

09:35.870 --> 09:42.080
We have, for instance, that we have W Google Dot Com and then forward slash and we can have, for

09:42.080 --> 09:49.880
instance, I don't know, city name like this is equal to Spokane or Seattle.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.480
OK, so that stadium?

09:51.530 --> 09:52.310
So what are we doing here?

09:52.580 --> 09:59.660
We're passing this city name or city variable along so that we can then pass something when we receive

09:59.660 --> 10:06.020
something from our text field, then pass that variable along, hopefully with some data.

10:06.470 --> 10:07.520
That's all we doing here.

10:08.390 --> 10:08.690
OK.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.630
Well, it's not the whole picture yet, but that's the idea.

10:12.230 --> 10:17.780
OK, now once we have that, we have to do something else because in our composable here, if you go

10:17.780 --> 10:22.520
over, you will see that we can pass other things other than just the route.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.730
We can pass the arguments that can pass the blinks and so forth.

10:26.090 --> 10:26.270
Right.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.000
This is good.

10:27.020 --> 10:27.710
This is helpful.

10:27.980 --> 10:33.500
That means then as a parameter or an argument, in this case, I'm going to pass the arguments no pun

10:33.500 --> 10:33.970
intended.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.950
Of course, I did not know that.

10:36.380 --> 10:37.310
It's called arguments.

10:37.820 --> 10:38.180
All right.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.890
And in this argument here, it's actually going to be a list of something.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.810
It's arguments that argument arguments like this.

10:46.820 --> 10:47.090
OK?

10:47.510 --> 10:51.830
It's going to be a list of because we can pass a list of arguments.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.710
But we just going to pass one.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.970
But in this case, they always allow us to pass.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.000
Actually, they want us to pass a list.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.680
That's no problem.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.080
Now we can't just pass a list like just a string.

11:05.090 --> 11:09.140
We need to wrap it around a navigation argument.

11:09.620 --> 11:09.950
OK.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.880
So say now I've already made all of this is given as we see there.

11:14.510 --> 11:15.320
We can just use it.

11:15.680 --> 11:24.230
And I argued it allows us to pass in this case, a string and Inov and in nav argument builder to build

11:24.380 --> 11:28.550
around that argument that we passing around because all of this.

11:29.210 --> 11:35.990
Remember, we are putting all of this infrastructure together because we are one to make sure that this

11:35.990 --> 11:38.060
works with the navigation system.

11:39.610 --> 11:39.810
OK.

11:40.600 --> 11:40.900
All right.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.450
So for the name.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.190
Well, what is the name of this variable going to be passing?

11:45.220 --> 11:48.910
Well, it's going to be City has to be exactly the same where we chose here.

11:49.060 --> 11:52.180
This could be monkey could be dog you.

11:52.180 --> 11:54.430
You know anything you want, but it has to be the same.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.990
Consistency is very important.

11:56.860 --> 11:57.190
OK.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.180
So this is also Alhambra.

11:59.200 --> 12:06.460
We can just put their trailing lambda to say, then we need to pass the type that we passing here.

12:06.470 --> 12:09.040
So in this case is going to be a string type.

12:10.130 --> 12:10.460
OK.

12:12.300 --> 12:18.630
Now, swing type, what that means is we need to specify what kind of objects in this case, what kind

12:18.630 --> 12:26.220
of values, what kind of pieces of data we're passing because you could pass a list of something you

12:26.220 --> 12:28.530
could pass an object, you could pass all sorts of things.

12:28.830 --> 12:33.240
In this case was saying, we want a string type, which is exactly what we passing is just a string.

12:34.520 --> 12:34.970
That's all.

12:35.970 --> 12:36.300
All right.

12:37.080 --> 12:37.380
OK.

12:37.740 --> 12:40.560
It's looks complicated, but it really isn't that complicated.

12:40.980 --> 12:41.280
All right.

12:41.550 --> 12:45.420
Now inside here, then this is where we were before.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.190
This is we've seen before this way.

12:47.550 --> 12:54.540
So you see here we have this implicit nav back stack entry, which is just a variable.

12:54.540 --> 13:00.000
That is, what can we get right from our arguments, actually from our composable?

13:00.690 --> 13:07.500
So what this allows us to do allows us to do many things, such as getting the arguments and so forth.

13:08.070 --> 13:09.270
What I mean by that is as follow.

13:09.480 --> 13:17.610
So I'm going to actually add a name, call this nav back like this so we can use it to do what do we

13:17.610 --> 13:17.970
need to do?

13:18.720 --> 13:23.430
So now I'm going to say nav back stack entry object, and I'm going to say arguments.

13:23.730 --> 13:24.210
Look at that.

13:24.210 --> 13:29.820
It's a bundle, which means it's another structure, another class that are class that allows us to

13:29.820 --> 13:33.300
bundle up pieces of data and you can see the naming.

13:33.300 --> 13:39.690
It's very important, right bundle bundle of data just to think of a package that will contain other

13:39.690 --> 13:40.600
pieces of data inside.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.610
That's exactly what it is.

13:41.610 --> 13:48.180
So we're creating through our nav back stack, we say, Hey, let's go ahead and put together this bundle

13:48.510 --> 13:52.050
of a box that we can put all these pieces of data.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.990
That way we can pass that along.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.650
And whoever gets it, they can open as a present Christmas present and they can get data.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.480
That's exactly what's happening, really, guys.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.130
Nothing really too fancy.

14:02.490 --> 14:02.790
OK.

14:03.270 --> 14:04.920
So we have the arguments.

14:05.310 --> 14:11.670
Wonderful, then we need to continue and say, Get string.

14:12.090 --> 14:12.870
Now why?

14:12.870 --> 14:14.160
And how do I know with his string?

14:14.160 --> 14:17.700
Well, I just said here the type we're passing is a string type.

14:19.250 --> 14:19.550
Right.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.800
Therefore, it has to be a string.

14:21.890 --> 14:26.660
When I retrieve that information, when I went to retrieve that data.

14:27.380 --> 14:27.650
Right.

14:28.070 --> 14:29.210
So I need to pass the key.

14:30.140 --> 14:31.120
What is the key?

14:31.130 --> 14:31.820
A city.

14:32.030 --> 14:36.290
So I say City again, has to be the same name.

14:36.350 --> 14:37.760
Otherwise, it's not going to work.

14:38.450 --> 14:38.780
All right.

14:39.230 --> 14:42.080
So once that happens, I'm going to use the lat block.

14:42.620 --> 14:48.920
OK, this light block allows us to run the code that will take advantage of whatever is being passed

14:48.920 --> 14:49.300
along.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.010
So this case here when we get that string?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.230
Well, in this case, we passed the key.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.690
That means we're going to get the value.

14:57.050 --> 14:58.490
So where is the value?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.650
Well, the value is going to be in this block.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.740
Again, as the string there.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.950
Huh, interesting, right?

15:07.250 --> 15:07.550
All right.

15:07.580 --> 15:12.410
That means that I can take all of these other code we had before and pass it all there.

15:13.340 --> 15:19.370
Now the great thing here, the look, how beautiful this is, the great thing here is that now because

15:19.370 --> 15:22.080
I have this it, by the way, this is what it is again.

15:22.100 --> 15:22.580
What is it?

15:22.700 --> 15:28.700
Well, is it is the value, the key value that we are passing along?

15:29.820 --> 15:34.350
Which is needed because we need that back to our main screen, right?

15:34.770 --> 15:37.950
So to facilitate here, I might.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.140
In fact, I'll just leave as it, but I for want.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.910
I can just say city like that.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.290
Let's just say City.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.390
I think that's that's appropriate.

15:45.990 --> 15:50.370
OK, so have the city, the actual city, the actual value.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.030
Not right.

15:52.260 --> 15:57.450
And so now I'm going to pass it along on main screen because remember, the whole idea is that main

15:57.450 --> 16:03.060
screen retrieves or gets in that city that was added, you know, a search screen, right?

16:04.140 --> 16:05.370
That's why we're doing all of this.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.650
But how do we pass it along?

16:08.250 --> 16:17.040
Well, we say comma and we pass a city like that as an argument, and I'm going to say City.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.260
Which city is this one?

16:20.410 --> 16:23.950
Now it's going to complain because they're going to say main screen doesn't know what cities.

16:24.010 --> 16:26.320
Of course he doesn't because we haven't added it.

16:26.710 --> 16:30.120
So let's create parameters, city and it's OK.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.960
Just added like this should be good.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.070
OK.

16:36.260 --> 16:36.860
And that's it.

16:38.140 --> 16:42.890
This is how you pass parameters past data through your composable.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.260
Let's go to main screen.

16:47.160 --> 16:52.440
You notice in our main screen now the beauty, because we added at City.

16:52.890 --> 16:54.450
Look at that and it's Nullarbor.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.340
Let's open up like this.

16:56.970 --> 16:57.780
What we can do.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.130
Look how cool this is.

16:59.550 --> 16:59.880
All right.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.200
I just can't help it.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.310
I can see logged.

17:02.550 --> 17:06.460
So you can see, OK.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.180
And it's and then again, just CD like this.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.990
Let's just wrap it with a tag.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.060
That's totally fine.

17:14.070 --> 17:15.420
We don't mind that.

17:15.810 --> 17:18.120
Let's run this in now.

17:18.120 --> 17:23.310
You can see when we go to search, add something, go back to main screen.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.700
We're going to see the city that was just added.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.510
Let's see.

17:32.510 --> 17:32.940
Oops!

17:32.960 --> 17:34.490
Looks like we have a problem.

17:36.350 --> 17:44.180
What seems to be right, the problem here is as follows, it says that navigation this nation that matches

17:44.630 --> 17:51.080
request main screen cannot be found in navigation graph route splash.

17:51.590 --> 17:59.060
OK, so if we go to our splash screen, the reason that's happening is because we've changed a few things

17:59.060 --> 18:01.040
actually right in our composable.

18:01.850 --> 18:07.430
But remember that the main screen is actually called somewhere else, because if you look at let's go

18:07.430 --> 18:09.680
to our splash screen, I think that's going to help.

18:13.340 --> 18:18.860
If you look at our splash screen, you will see that after a few seconds, it will say knife controller.

18:19.310 --> 18:21.360
And then we go to main screen as such.

18:21.380 --> 18:24.950
So now he's saying, Well, yes, I can go there.

18:25.100 --> 18:32.240
But the problem is that you've said that when I navigate to the main screen, I must pass some sort

18:32.240 --> 18:33.430
of city, right?

18:33.440 --> 18:34.220
Because that's what I've said.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.050
That's why we have an issue.

18:36.380 --> 18:39.200
So for now, I'm just going to put a default seat.

18:40.010 --> 18:46.610
So I'm going to say plus and the way we do this, we are going to put a forward slash like this and

18:46.610 --> 18:50.510
put, say, default city, which I haven't created yet.

18:53.130 --> 18:59.280
So at the top here, I'm just going to say, wow, the fourth city, you say.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.350
San Diego like that.

19:04.790 --> 19:05.930
Now this is going to work.

19:06.870 --> 19:07.290
All right.

19:08.010 --> 19:08.650
Does it make sense?

19:08.910 --> 19:15.510
And we have to add it this way because remember, all of these routes are being seen just like links

19:16.140 --> 19:17.070
in web development.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.820
So we need to put forward slash and then default city like this.

19:22.030 --> 19:22.410
OK.

19:22.830 --> 19:23.260
That's right.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.780
And you can see.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.360
OK, it's working perfectly.

19:31.610 --> 19:38.000
Now, it's not saying San Diego here is because somewhere along the way we actually changed this to

19:38.000 --> 19:40.280
say Maputo, in fact, I know exactly where that is.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.920
If you go to the main screen, we added Maputo here.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.650
OK, so that's fine.

19:46.490 --> 19:49.370
OK, now here's the thing.

19:49.760 --> 19:55.820
Let's go to search and I'm going to say Seattle hit enter.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.050
And if I go back.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.760
Let's see if I see.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.260
Right.

20:04.840 --> 20:12.010
Actually, in order for this to work, I'm getting ahead of myself here when we navigate.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.490
Let's go back to our search screen for you to see exactly what are we getting?

20:20.060 --> 20:23.820
Right, I'm not doing anything here, all I'm doing, I'm just saying search, screen and enter.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.620
That's not what I want to do.

20:24.620 --> 20:28.430
I want to actually navigate back to our main screen.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.180
That makes sense.

20:29.390 --> 20:34.760
So all I do, I say now I've control it because I have access to enough controller and let's say, navigate,

20:35.330 --> 20:38.120
remember to get the root string one like that.

20:38.540 --> 20:42.920
And then I'm going to say whether screen's right or enum.

20:43.340 --> 20:43.820
Whoops.

20:44.150 --> 20:44.900
Let's see.

20:49.650 --> 20:54.120
And name, they say, whether screens.

20:55.170 --> 21:00.900
Main screen, that is that name, and I'm going to do the same thing we did on a splash screen, I'm

21:00.900 --> 21:08.880
going to spend our friend there was just added right and it's going to be our city.

21:09.300 --> 21:13.890
Now, in this case, here we see a string or it.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.550
I'm just going to say, Am city like this?

21:19.380 --> 21:20.170
Wow, I like that.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.420
So this is what's going to happen.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.100
So we click on search.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.700
We add the search.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.050
In fact, let's just run and see how this will work.

21:30.610 --> 21:31.330
OK, let's go.

21:32.950 --> 21:38.470
I'm going to say Seattle hit enter Whyalla.

21:39.370 --> 21:40.150
We went back.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.850
If we go to Logcat, there is Seattle in from our main screen.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.180
Very cool.

21:49.270 --> 21:52.420
If I change to, let's say, Moscow.

21:56.590 --> 21:59.950
You should see Moscow.

22:01.240 --> 22:01.530
There.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.950
Look how easy things get now in our main screen.

22:06.310 --> 22:11.380
We said we got the city from army, from our screen in this case, our.

22:12.850 --> 22:18.040
Search screen, that means then I can take this city and added here dynamically.

22:18.660 --> 22:22.140
I look at this look how easy this will look now I say City.

22:24.850 --> 22:25.510
Like that?

22:29.210 --> 22:32.750
Looks like it needs some wrapping to string.

22:32.780 --> 22:33.170
Sure.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.170
Voila.

22:34.710 --> 22:37.220
OK, look, what's going to happen when I run this?

22:38.800 --> 22:45.070
Now, the first default is going to happen because from here, it's going to go and voila.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.870
San Diego, why San Diego?

22:47.230 --> 22:52.180
Because, you know, a splash screen, we said, well, default seat is going to be San Diego when they

22:52.180 --> 22:53.080
first come in.

22:53.710 --> 22:59.170
We have to have some sort of defaults, default city, which is exactly what happened because we passed

22:59.170 --> 23:01.030
that along in our navigation.

23:01.390 --> 23:01.890
Wonderful.

23:01.900 --> 23:02.380
It's working.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.280
Now check this out.

23:03.610 --> 23:04.480
Let's go to search.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.090
I'm going to say Moscow.

23:07.390 --> 23:07.900
Why not?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.370
Because we can click.

23:09.370 --> 23:10.080
We go back.

23:10.090 --> 23:10.580
There we go.

23:10.600 --> 23:15.310
Moscow and everything changed now because the way we've set everything up.

23:15.550 --> 23:19.780
It goes ahead and says, get weather data passes in the city.

23:19.960 --> 23:25.630
Now the city is indeed the city that we've just added, right, you know, search bar and pulls in the

23:25.630 --> 23:27.400
information about Moscow.

23:27.760 --> 23:36.040
If I go and say, let's say my portal like this, click.

23:36.850 --> 23:37.780
Now it's my photo.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.670
And while if I search for something else, I say Mumbai.

23:44.820 --> 23:50.100
And goes back Mumbai and is getting the weather information for Mumbai.

23:51.450 --> 23:51.810
Great.

23:52.110 --> 23:52.770
It's working.

23:54.770 --> 23:55.970
OK, I get it.

23:56.420 --> 24:02.990
So this is a pretty long video, and I apologize for that, but I hope you were able to follow along

24:02.990 --> 24:05.060
and see exactly the process right.

24:05.060 --> 24:11.760
It took my time because I want you to understand exactly how we go about routing everything and passing

24:11.760 --> 24:15.260
in data, passing in information from droughts and so forth.

24:15.510 --> 24:15.860
OK.

24:16.010 --> 24:16.790
And there you go.

24:16.820 --> 24:17.330
It works.

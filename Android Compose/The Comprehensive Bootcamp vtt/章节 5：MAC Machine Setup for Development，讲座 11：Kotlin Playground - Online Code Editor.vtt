There is another option if you want to run cattle in code, right?

00:05.340 --> 00:10.590
So if you go to Google and type cattle in playground, this should show up.

00:10.710 --> 00:15.840
So I'm going to click this first link and should take us to a page like this.

00:15.870 --> 00:17.930
Now you may not see this.

00:17.940 --> 00:23.130
In fact, you may see something a little bit different with a little bit of code or comments at the

00:23.130 --> 00:23.590
top here.

00:23.610 --> 00:26.350
The reason why it's like this is because I've been here before.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.020
And so it's saved what I had written before.

00:29.320 --> 00:35.100
So you probably are going to have something like this that says hello, world of some sort and some

00:35.100 --> 00:37.050
code or comment at the top of me.

00:37.230 --> 00:37.980
That doesn't matter.

00:38.070 --> 00:41.480
What matters is that this it's what you call Scotland playground.

00:41.490 --> 00:46.760
So it's a place where you can come and write code Kotlin code and run it and see the results.

00:46.770 --> 00:51.180
So it's really simple and easy and fast if you want just something real quick.

00:51.180 --> 00:56.970
Instead of going through the IDP Android Studio, as I showed you, you can come straight here and start

00:57.120 --> 00:58.260
typing Kotlin code.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.730
So it's a really great place.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.960
It's a playground, right?

01:00.960 --> 01:04.860
So you go and play with some ideas and learn stuff in this case, codling.

01:05.430 --> 01:07.290
So in this case, here you can do the same thing.

01:07.290 --> 01:11.340
If you see that we have the fun main and it's a function, right?

01:11.550 --> 01:15.600
And then inside you have this print L.N. or print could be print as well.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.650
The print Ellen works.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.280
In fact, if I go like this, I think this will work.

01:19.340 --> 01:19.920
I see.

01:20.370 --> 01:21.210
Yes, it will work.

01:21.210 --> 01:25.160
Print Alan its print line, which means going to go to a different line each time.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.990
But anyway, print, he's going to print Hello World.

01:27.990 --> 01:33.810
As you see there, if I say print Alan, slightly different, of course, going to print a new line

01:33.810 --> 01:37.560
every time we want to print something else anyway.

01:38.070 --> 01:43.350
OK, so that's the main point here is that we can do the same thing we did in our Android Studio.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.840
I can say foul, just say name.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.600
Set it to something, James.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.590
OK and change here and invoke James the variable.

01:52.590 --> 01:56.370
I can just put the dollar sign and say name.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.670
It even has code suggestion, which is real handy.

02:00.210 --> 02:00.540
All right.

02:00.540 --> 02:03.430
And going to go ahead and run, we should see in the second.

02:03.450 --> 02:05.100
Hello, James, forget it.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.240
So that's another option.

02:06.450 --> 02:12.060
And there are a lot of things you can do with in codling playground, I should say, one of which is

02:12.060 --> 02:14.520
you can share this code here for click here.

02:14.790 --> 02:17.640
You can embed medium embed out of places.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.300
There is a code.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.800
You can actually copy this and send to your friends or somebody to look at your code.

02:23.280 --> 02:23.550
OK.

02:23.850 --> 02:28.170
So really, there's hands on as examples and so forth, but I like this option as well.

02:28.500 --> 02:33.600
If you want to exploit it more than welcome or you can just stick it to Android Studio.

02:33.630 --> 02:34.560
It doesn't really matter.

02:35.250 --> 02:35.590
All right.

02:35.610 --> 02:36.200
There you have it.

02:36.210 --> 02:40.050
You have another option, which is codling playground.

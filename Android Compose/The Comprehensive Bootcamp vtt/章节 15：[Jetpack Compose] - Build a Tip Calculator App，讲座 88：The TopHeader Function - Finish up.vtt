WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:00.820
OK.

00:00.870 --> 00:06.150
So because when it's out of surface, I hope we were able to actually get the color or at least be able

00:06.150 --> 00:08.170
to change the background color for a symbol.

00:08.430 --> 00:14.730
If you have a Silver Surfer, you find the color argumento color parameter there.

00:15.130 --> 00:22.890
OK, so after shape, which is here, really, I can just go say comma and say color.

00:23.760 --> 00:28.140
And in this case, here I have a color I found on the internet.

00:28.260 --> 00:32.430
The Hex code for it, and I'm just going to go ahead and pass here.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.540
OK, it's very simple.

00:34.080 --> 00:41.190
So first, we start with by saying zero x to say this is a hex color and then f f and then I'm going

00:41.190 --> 00:50.540
to just start typing e 9d and then seven f the seven f seven.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.440
I believe that's the color get.

00:53.790 --> 00:54.690
All right, there we go.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.690
And can see in the gutter here it shows the color.

00:57.960 --> 01:01.590
If you click here, of course, you can change the color from here as well.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.610
That's really, really neat.

01:02.620 --> 01:07.350
So once you add a color, you can always come to the got it here and click and play with that color.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.260
All right, let's go ahead and refresh real quick.

01:10.260 --> 01:12.120
We should see the change.

01:13.240 --> 01:13.870
And there you go.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.190
Looks we'll get.

01:16.740 --> 01:22.380
OK, so now let's go back to our column, so this is where we are going to focus on adding these two

01:23.010 --> 01:23.980
texts, really.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.890
So the total per person and then where we will have the total amount.

01:29.910 --> 01:34.530
So it is going to be in a column because we said this structure here is top to bottom.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.200
Everything is a line from top to bottom right.

01:37.350 --> 01:38.280
One after the other.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.020
So a column would work.

01:40.770 --> 01:43.680
OK, so let's go ahead and start putting text here.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.500
For now, I'm just going to say total poor person.

01:53.170 --> 01:54.910
Copy that text.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.740
And this is going to be.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.920
I always say it's nice to put the named arguments.

02:04.440 --> 02:11.150
It's always a good idea, I say text again like that and this one, I'm going to say.

02:13.180 --> 02:14.130
1:34.

02:15.010 --> 02:15.410
OK.

02:15.910 --> 02:17.260
Let's go ahead and take a look.

02:19.450 --> 02:22.630
And you can see it's very small, but there it is.

02:23.620 --> 02:28.960
I can see some historical person, but it's not necessarily where we want it to be because we want this

02:28.960 --> 02:31.000
to be in the middle of the screen.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.130
How do we do that inside of our column?

02:33.130 --> 02:38.410
Here, we can specify the horizontal alignment, as well as the vertical arrangement.

02:38.910 --> 02:40.570
And there's a difference in naming here.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.730
So we've got to be very mindful of that.

02:43.270 --> 02:45.260
But before we do that, we need to pass.

02:45.280 --> 02:52.270
We could if we wanted to pass a modifier because modifiers always usually the first argument to pass

02:52.630 --> 02:54.070
and order is very important.

02:54.670 --> 03:00.820
So let's start with the modifier, and I want just to say padding all around inside here.

03:00.820 --> 03:03.040
I just want to give about 12 dpi.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.180
All right.

03:04.180 --> 03:09.610
So once I have that, let's move on to say horizontal lines or typing alignment.

03:09.740 --> 03:15.970
When you say alignment and I want this to be horizontally center horizontally like that.

03:16.510 --> 03:19.050
And also, I want a vertical arrangement.

03:19.390 --> 03:20.980
Notice the naming here is different.

03:20.980 --> 03:25.870
It's not again, alignment now is arrangement because we are arranging things vertically.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.540
OK, now I want this to be.

03:29.930 --> 03:38.300
Centre as such, so if I refresh now, we should make sure or should see, hopefully the tax is going

03:38.300 --> 03:42.410
to be in the middle, all of the text, which are the contents inside of our column.

03:42.830 --> 03:44.030
This should all be in the middle.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.630
Of the top header.

03:46.810 --> 03:47.560
And there you have it.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.000
He looks really good.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.140
It's in the middle there.

03:50.780 --> 03:55.150
The next thing we want to do is, of course, do some styling, you know, attacks here.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.840
Well, we can go inside of each one of them.

03:57.850 --> 04:03.850
In this case, the text, the first one that says tomorrow, horrible person, and we can do a few things.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.610
He is aware of what a comma next.

04:06.910 --> 04:12.160
If you have over again, if whenever you are in doubt, you can hover over to see what arguments we

04:12.160 --> 04:12.670
can pass.

04:13.540 --> 04:14.960
So there's a lot of things you can pass.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.900
Font size, one style and so forth.

04:17.320 --> 04:22.750
Now again, we can also pass if I say, for instance, style.

04:22.780 --> 04:25.960
Of course, that is one of the parameters or arguments in this case.

04:26.260 --> 04:33.460
I can say text style and start passing all of these parameters arguments in cytotec style.

04:33.940 --> 04:41.500
Or if I want to facilitate my life and I want to use the material, I want to use the theme of this

04:41.500 --> 04:41.740
app.

04:41.740 --> 04:46.690
I can see material like this and get the theme object there and say, Dad.

04:47.020 --> 04:51.550
And we say colors, and I can choose all these different colors if I want to.

04:51.880 --> 04:59.800
Or I can just see that typography and get different typography, sizes and style he can see to the right

04:59.800 --> 05:00.040
here.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.810
These are indeed textiles.

05:02.380 --> 05:03.310
So it's very helpful.

05:03.510 --> 05:09.220
OK, now in this case, I would just want this to be a little bit larger.

05:09.220 --> 05:10.360
So maybe H4 can.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.040
We can always come and change, of course.

05:12.610 --> 05:21.640
And then for the next one, make maybe this H5 and for the next one here, I'm going to say style again.

05:24.350 --> 05:32.210
Passing a material theme and typography and age four, so a little bit larger than the previous one.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.040
Let's refresh.

05:35.030 --> 05:35.330
OK.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.140
It looks really good.

05:38.230 --> 05:39.640
Very similar to what we have here.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.280
One thing you notice is that this.

05:43.950 --> 05:46.800
Tax here is bolder than the previous one, right?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.570
So we can still work on this.

05:49.110 --> 05:54.520
There's nothing that is that will hinder us from doing that so I can come afterwards.

05:54.540 --> 06:00.990
I can say, for instance, font weight, right, and say font weight, or I can just go ahead and start

06:00.990 --> 06:01.470
typing.

06:01.470 --> 06:06.660
Bold writing can see now it's going to go and get the variables.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.510
Don't go ahead and get these variables here.

06:09.540 --> 06:12.480
Bold, extra bold, let's use extra bold as such.

06:12.990 --> 06:18.990
Now if you refresh, you can see that you will see hopefully in a second here the changes.

06:21.180 --> 06:25.560
There we go on in 34 looks way, way better, just like these.

06:25.590 --> 06:26.370
What do we have here?

06:26.700 --> 06:32.940
So simply, you can see how easy it is really to build user interface is using with compose.

06:33.330 --> 06:40.020
And the beauty of what we did here, which is to organize or to look at our app, the overall application

06:40.020 --> 06:40.950
in smaller chunks.

06:41.040 --> 06:45.750
It's really helpful because if you are starting and you look at something like this, I know this is

06:45.750 --> 06:46.680
a very simple.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.730
It's a very simple application, but you can imagine how daunting that could be because you look at

06:50.730 --> 06:54.380
it all of this and you're thinking, Oh my goodness, there's a lot of work to do here.

06:54.390 --> 06:55.080
Yes, there is.

06:55.080 --> 07:02.070
But if you split things into smaller chunks, it's manageable and easier and you feel like you are making

07:02.070 --> 07:04.230
progress as you build these smaller chunks.

07:04.620 --> 07:11.730
You'll notice that obviously this price here, this I should say this number, this amount will change

07:11.730 --> 07:16.290
dynamically, and we go back to the idea of what composable functions do.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.740
The idea is that they were kind of reactive to the data they receive, right?

07:20.790 --> 07:27.720
They get data and they they know, OK, how am I going to draw myself to to show this data that I'm

07:27.720 --> 07:28.830
receiving, right?

07:29.520 --> 07:36.930
So that tells us that then this top header here, we should pass that data because this is going to

07:36.930 --> 07:42.930
be called somewhere we don't know, and we need to pass the data, which is going to be this amount

07:43.620 --> 07:49.260
which is going to be calculated by somebody or some other function that we don't know and displayed

07:49.260 --> 07:50.610
here, right?

07:51.330 --> 07:56.640
All this function will now this compose or function will now is that I need some data.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.500
I don't know who is going to give it to me.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.180
I don't know where it's going to come from.

08:00.390 --> 08:04.830
I don't know how to calculate whatever results from that data.

08:05.490 --> 08:07.240
All I need is just that information.

08:07.260 --> 08:07.980
The piece of data.

08:08.730 --> 08:16.770
So here I'm going to create put a total per per per person like this and it's going to be a double.

08:17.460 --> 08:25.500
And because I want it to still be able to see the preview, I'm going to set it to, you know, zero

08:25.720 --> 08:26.520
zero, right?

08:26.670 --> 08:28.260
This is default argument.

08:29.820 --> 08:32.730
All right, now, I'm going to call this somewhere.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.550
Recall that inside here.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.040
OK, let's go ahead and refresh.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.720
All right, there you go, we see who have zero.

08:42.080 --> 08:48.830
Now we're going to hand the dollar sign like this, and that should probably make it look better.

08:50.630 --> 08:57.890
Like that now, if you look at our number here, we have two decimal digits there, so how do we do

08:57.890 --> 08:58.070
that?

08:58.610 --> 09:05.540
Well, we can use the power of cuddling here and format this number that when it comes in so that we

09:05.540 --> 09:07.790
have two decimal digits there.

09:08.390 --> 09:08.630
OK.

09:09.140 --> 09:16.460
So to facilitate everything, I'm just going to create a foul here called Toro, and it's going to be

09:16.760 --> 09:22.550
I'm going to pass here this very strange looking code, if you will.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.650
So what are we doing here?

09:23.660 --> 09:29.540
I'm going to put a percentage in put that to F. So what we're doing here is that then we're going to

09:29.540 --> 09:30.770
invoke the format.

09:32.970 --> 09:35.580
Function, right and pass.

09:35.850 --> 09:39.570
Of course, in this case, our total per person value.

09:39.960 --> 09:44.640
So what are we doing here is that when we get this total per person value, we're going to format it

09:44.760 --> 09:47.820
so that it has two decimal digit, I should say.

09:48.090 --> 09:55.620
Let's actually change this two hundred and thirty three zero, which you'd call total here, and we

09:55.620 --> 09:57.030
should solve the problem.

09:57.090 --> 09:59.760
We should see one three four nine zero zero.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.020
And there you have it.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.210
Small things, but they do matter.

10:03.510 --> 10:03.780
All right.

10:03.780 --> 10:04.890
So we're making good progress.

10:04.890 --> 10:10.720
In fact, I would argue that we are done with our top header as it is right now.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.410
So now that we have a top header, it's all done.

10:13.740 --> 10:18.750
We can actually call it in our content inside of our my app, right?

10:18.780 --> 10:26.820
So I can get rid of this top top header and we don't have to pass anything because we have a default

10:27.180 --> 10:28.740
value there of double.

10:29.250 --> 10:34.800
And this point we could run on our emulator if you wanted to.

10:36.860 --> 10:40.050
I set up my phone here, so I'm going to go ahead and run if you want.

10:40.050 --> 10:44.430
You can run that, of course, on on the on an emulator that comes with Android.

10:44.430 --> 10:48.180
But I have my phone that is connected and there you have it.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.300
This is actually running on my phone right now.

10:51.750 --> 10:52.010
OK.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.370
So it's looking real good.

10:53.760 --> 10:59.880
Of course, we will put all of this together and make it look even better with other components or other

11:00.390 --> 11:01.800
composable functions there.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.410
But at least he can see things are working fine.

00:00.630 --> 00:07.140
Although we can use, obviously Android Studio and create a module so we can write some common code

00:07.140 --> 00:08.430
as we learn about Kotlin.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.290
There are other options out there.

00:10.290 --> 00:16.680
So if you want something different as opposed to working in an Android studio for Kotlin, you can go

00:16.680 --> 00:19.470
to Google and type in Kotlin Playground.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.560
Usually the first hit you get, that's where you need to go.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.860
So let's click on codling playground of such, and this should open.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.880
In fact, I've been working here.

00:28.890 --> 00:31.320
That's why we have some code already.

00:31.530 --> 00:36.270
But for you, you should probably just have something that says Hello world, so it should have something

00:36.510 --> 00:40.800
that would say print hello world.

00:41.100 --> 00:41.970
Something like this.

00:42.240 --> 00:42.540
OK.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.900
It's an amazing tool that is for free.

00:44.910 --> 00:51.210
It's online and you can use this tool as well to write some Kotlin code and learn about Kotlin.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.450
OK, so it's just another option I would like to give to you.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.280
You can read more about this playground online playground, but it's really simple.

00:59.580 --> 01:08.290
The government can do something like Val, save my name and just give it a value of James, for instance.

01:08.430 --> 01:16.050
Of course, we can then pass in side of or print there and put the dollar sign to invoke the variable

01:16.050 --> 01:19.940
say my name as such and picks that up.

01:19.950 --> 01:20.430
And voila!

01:20.670 --> 01:22.260
So to run, it's very simple.

01:22.260 --> 01:26.760
You just click on this one button and it's going to run and print out James.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.240
It's a very good alternative for learning about Colin and writing your Kotlin code.

01:32.250 --> 01:35.040
So whichever one you want to use, I don't mind.

01:35.190 --> 01:39.990
I just stick to one, or you can interchangeably use both of them as we go through cuddling.

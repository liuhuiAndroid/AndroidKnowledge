00:00.550 --> 00:07.570
Let's go and see if we can put together extension function that will remove the first and last character.

00:08.050 --> 00:08.390
All right.

00:08.470 --> 00:11.980
You may have been able to do this, but let's go ahead and try real quick here.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.770
So it's a fun string, of course.

00:15.100 --> 00:20.650
And then I'm going to say remove first and last.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.050
Charles, OK.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.870
Rather long name, but that's fine.

00:27.710 --> 00:32.900
So what I'm going to pass, anything is going to be a string that's going to be expected to return.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.110
And in this case, I'm just going to say return, right?

00:36.110 --> 00:39.080
And there's going to be this string that we are painting this to.

00:39.860 --> 00:45.630
When I use the substring method or function in passing.

00:46.610 --> 00:54.140
The first item that we need to remove and then we're going to pass the last one and to get it the last

00:54.140 --> 00:59.930
one, because this is going to transform their strength into, of course, a an array or list.

00:59.990 --> 01:03.140
We can say this at length, right?

01:03.590 --> 01:07.340
And then minus one to get the last item.

01:09.310 --> 01:10.450
Oops, minus one.

01:11.860 --> 01:14.200
And this has to be written like this.

01:14.680 --> 01:21.280
And as you know, right now, we can just get rid of all of this and all of that, and I say equal like

01:21.280 --> 01:21.730
this.

01:21.970 --> 01:25.750
Put that in one long line, and there you have it.

01:26.590 --> 01:35.230
So now we can use it by, say, print, for instance, in the message and again, to say, this is fun.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.970
And then for that on that string, I get inside because it's a string.

01:40.990 --> 01:43.870
This is going to be read as a string, as you saw before.

01:44.650 --> 01:51.880
It is a string and we say dot and say remove first and last charge.

01:52.300 --> 01:58.120
The beauty is that, as I told you earlier, is that we can invoke this extension function as if we

01:58.960 --> 02:01.090
as if it came with cuddling.

02:01.810 --> 02:02.290
All right.

02:02.860 --> 02:03.430
That's really good.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.680
OK, so there you have it.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.360
Let's go ahead and run this.

02:08.550 --> 02:14.910
And you can see his is full because we remove the first and the last.

02:16.310 --> 02:16.910
Characters.

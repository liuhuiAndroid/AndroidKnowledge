WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:05.730
All right, so the app is pretty much done, and now we can just go and look at a few things we can

00:05.730 --> 00:12.390
add, for instance, in our markup here, we can see that we have this this thumbs up in some of these

00:12.390 --> 00:12.710
books.

00:12.720 --> 00:19.140
So essentially, we can add an if statement that says, OK, if the rating of the book that we've given

00:19.590 --> 00:25.410
is, say, greater or equal to four right, then we can add it thumbs now.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.510
Then we can add it thumbs up or something like this.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.670
So that's just something extra we can do.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.290
I'm going to show you how to do that so you can adjust to your liking.

00:35.220 --> 00:42.540
So back to our reader states screen there and we have this column which will have this go to the actual

00:42.540 --> 00:42.810
app.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.570
So we're talking about here.

00:46.140 --> 00:53.070
So let's see, we want to add, perhaps at the end of this title there, we want to add indication that

00:53.070 --> 00:54.800
this was a good book, right?

00:54.840 --> 00:58.200
Depending on the rating for the title here, what I can do.

00:58.260 --> 01:06.030
I'm going to wrap this inside and say, let's put it inside of a row that inside there and I'm going

01:06.030 --> 01:07.530
to add horizontal.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.140
Arrangement.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.450
Want space in between?

01:14.170 --> 01:15.280
And so.

01:18.310 --> 01:22.720
And so I'm going to see say if book that reading

01:25.360 --> 01:38.410
is greater than or equal to, let's say for anything greater than or equal for, we are going to add

01:38.440 --> 01:39.640
I'm going to add a space, sir.

01:40.030 --> 01:40.780
OK with here.

01:43.190 --> 01:46.190
Safe, you know, Max, with.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.260
And I'm going to shrink it a little bit.

01:49.450 --> 01:49.740
Right?

01:50.460 --> 02:00.720
So that season zero Act eight, if this is going to help us with moving the icon, we're going to add

02:01.140 --> 02:03.870
to the end of of the row.

02:04.260 --> 02:04.650
All right.

02:04.830 --> 02:07.080
So then I'm going to say I can't.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.040
When you factor there, say I can start.

02:15.910 --> 02:16.780
Default.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.410
Let's put thumbs.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.620
Thumbs up for the content description.

02:30.090 --> 02:37.350
And we can ask what's changed tint colour, hair color that red actually say green.

02:40.140 --> 02:47.580
A copy of the zero point five that's like this.

02:48.980 --> 02:55.550
Why else we're just going to pass in a box that's empty?

02:56.180 --> 02:56.930
It's going to run.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.280
OK, let's see if we're going to have any books, right?

03:02.310 --> 03:06.990
So have a few books plus ratings you can see it shows there.

03:07.230 --> 03:13.070
You can see this one is really small because it depends on the size of our text.

03:13.080 --> 03:18.900
And as can see, let's change the structure here because I want to make sure that we have author started

03:18.900 --> 03:19.880
and finished it.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.290
That's the information that we really want to see.

03:22.770 --> 03:29.530
So all of these guys, I can get rid of some of these or actually call something else.

03:29.530 --> 03:33.720
So let's say after the author, we're going to say started.

03:38.230 --> 03:42.190
And I'm gonna pass book that started.

03:43.830 --> 03:50.190
Reading this, and I want to make to say soft wrap.

03:52.160 --> 04:01.040
True, true, I guess for all of them, you have over whether the tax should break that soft line breaks,

04:01.220 --> 04:06.740
it falls into next position as if there was an unlimited horizontal space.

04:07.070 --> 04:08.200
So there we go.

04:08.210 --> 04:13.270
So we're just going to give this nice wrap if indeed the tax is too much or too long.

04:14.620 --> 04:18.730
All right, so next here, I'm going to put the finished.

04:29.840 --> 04:38.970
And it's going to look that finished reading and less crap that instead of format date.

04:39.640 --> 04:39.960
All right.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.630
I should be good, I swear, Ryan.

04:44.670 --> 04:45.810
Yeah, it's going to look.

04:47.340 --> 04:47.700
All right.

04:47.880 --> 04:48.600
Time stamp.

04:48.870 --> 04:53.430
We need to pass the same here for this one.

04:56.350 --> 04:57.630
I have to go all over.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.620
Start over.

05:03.780 --> 05:07.980
And they would go looks much better, and this is exactly what we want.

05:08.250 --> 05:08.700
All right.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.310
So now we have the whole app done.

05:11.430 --> 05:17.490
We've done a lot of work, a lot of sweat and tears, and I hope more sweat and tears, of course.

05:18.120 --> 05:23.060
And most importantly, I hope you were able to go through this and learned a lot.

05:23.100 --> 05:26.070
And I know this was a lot, but that was the intention.

05:26.070 --> 05:31.590
The intention was to put together a full fledged application here from ground up so you can see the

05:31.590 --> 05:32.650
process OK.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.370
And what I would like you to do.

05:35.520 --> 05:42.330
Well, I would like you to continue improving on this application or maybe take some ideas that you

05:42.330 --> 05:46.530
learned about that you learn while building his application and build your own.

05:46.710 --> 05:50.550
So we've learned a lot of things here, learned how to persist.

05:50.550 --> 05:59.340
Data in Firebase for our store will learn how to authorize or how to create users right and log them

05:59.340 --> 06:02.100
in, so create them account and lock them in.

06:02.370 --> 06:04.110
We'll learn how to structure our data.

06:04.110 --> 06:08.430
That way, we can then save books, of course, that we get from an API.

06:08.430 --> 06:15.450
In this case, Google API, Google Books API, and we'll learn how to extract that data will learn how

06:15.450 --> 06:22.170
to pass that data using different tools and different libraries that really help us get this information

06:22.170 --> 06:25.590
together so we can focus more on building the application.

06:25.590 --> 06:25.890
Okay?

06:26.220 --> 06:31.830
So a lot has happened, and please take your time to go through these sections.

06:31.830 --> 06:37.440
I hope you did, and you always have access to these videos so you can always go back to watch certain

06:37.440 --> 06:37.760
parts.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.000
It didn't make much sense.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.800
And the thing I would like to say is just be patient as you go through this.

06:43.800 --> 06:49.890
If this is your first time creating or going through this programming course or you still a little bit

06:49.890 --> 06:51.390
of a beginner, this is your first time.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.360
It's not going to come easy, right?

06:53.370 --> 06:54.060
For most of us.

06:54.060 --> 06:55.410
So it takes time.

06:55.410 --> 06:56.250
It takes practice.

06:56.250 --> 07:02.510
So be patient and always have the kind of attitude of, OK, let me look for the answer.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.720
Let me try to figure out why this is not working and then ask for help.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.800
Look for help for it.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.030
There's a lot of help online.

07:09.960 --> 07:15.060
StackOverflow is the place you should be familiar with when you have issues with programming and so

07:15.060 --> 07:15.270
forth.

07:15.270 --> 07:16.710
So have that spirit.

07:16.710 --> 07:17.640
It's really going to help.

07:17.640 --> 07:25.920
Of course, you can always, always ask questions in the forum and one of us it will help you get you

07:25.920 --> 07:27.240
back in the right track.

07:27.900 --> 07:32.540
All right, so thank you again for being on this journey with me.

07:32.550 --> 07:35.040
I really appreciate it, and I hope you've learned a lot.

07:36.060 --> 07:36.420
Thanks.

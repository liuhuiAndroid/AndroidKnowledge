00:00.330 --> 00:04.630
So we finished the update screen and everything is working fine.

00:04.650 --> 00:10.560
Now we want to go back to our main screen, our home screen, because we need to restructure a few things.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.500
First of all, if you remember correctly from the beginning of this course, or at least the beginning

00:16.620 --> 00:23.490
of the sections where we started putting together this app, I said that the idea is here is to categorize

00:23.610 --> 00:26.180
these books into two categories.

00:26.190 --> 00:31.980
The first one at the top is going to be the what the user is reading right now, and at the bottom it's

00:31.980 --> 00:33.240
going to just be the reading list.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.720
So if you users, when they add the book, all the added book.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.070
We'll go to the bottom trawling list.

00:40.550 --> 00:47.600
It's not until they click on the reading list item and they go to update the book and they can say,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.040
OK, I'm starting reading this.

00:49.340 --> 00:54.710
And if they do so, the moment they say started reading this, then we're going to transfer that book

00:54.890 --> 00:57.320
onto the you are reading activity right now.

00:57.530 --> 00:59.210
OK, so the top category.

01:00.170 --> 01:02.610
So that is the structure that is the flow.

01:02.630 --> 01:07.130
We need to add to this app to make it really work and worthwhile.

01:07.610 --> 01:08.660
OK, let's go ahead and do that.

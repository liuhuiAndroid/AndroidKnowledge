00:00.600 --> 00:05.070
So as it is, I don't really like this bold instead of bold here, let's say just light.

00:05.940 --> 00:07.230
I think this it's better.

00:07.770 --> 00:08.700
This refresh or quick.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.350
It's much better.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.580
OK, very good.

00:12.670 --> 00:19.090
So the other thing we can do, of course, to remember, was still inside of just a text.

00:19.270 --> 00:19.600
Right?

00:20.440 --> 00:26.620
So if you click here, the text ends here, it means here we can still pass, say, a modifier if you

00:26.620 --> 00:33.820
wanted to and say modifier padding one two padding of about six TATP.

00:34.150 --> 00:37.150
So all around, it's going to be 60p padding.

00:38.230 --> 00:38.530
All right.

00:39.190 --> 00:39.610
Very good.

00:39.880 --> 00:47.950
So once we've done this with adding the text, that first text here still inside here, it can add a

00:47.950 --> 00:48.580
divider.

00:50.530 --> 00:50.800
OK.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.170
And then I'm going to add another text.

00:53.740 --> 01:01.750
In this case, I'm just going to add director and it's going to be a movie.

01:03.850 --> 01:04.540
Director.

01:09.630 --> 01:10.620
Give us style.

01:19.400 --> 01:27.620
Caption, a search going to copy that a few times over and the next is going to be.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.250
Actors.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.700
Get actors.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.640
And then last one for now.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.290
You know, pass rating and we're going to get the rating in such.

01:46.430 --> 01:48.120
All right, let's see it, click.

01:49.100 --> 01:49.610
Voila!

01:49.640 --> 01:51.260
He can see there is the plot.

01:51.270 --> 01:55.070
We have that fighter there and director and so forth.

01:55.070 --> 01:56.380
So it's really, really nice.

01:56.390 --> 02:01.500
And of course, you can spend more time making it look more beautiful, but this looks really good.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.500
So I can what I can do.

02:02.510 --> 02:07.910
Also, it's gave a little bit of space padding at the top there, so you now are divider.

02:07.940 --> 02:10.550
If I have over, let's put a modifier here.

02:14.810 --> 02:17.990
They say padding.

02:21.190 --> 02:22.420
Much, much better, I like that.

02:23.930 --> 02:28.070
OK, let's see if we can run this on a device or emulator.

02:33.680 --> 02:33.980
OK.

02:34.010 --> 02:34.580
Let's see.

02:35.240 --> 02:35.660
Click.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.150
My line looks really good.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.680
And I can't go to another movie.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.920
And it's looking really good.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.800
So what we want to do next?

02:48.860 --> 02:52.550
Well, we're going to work on the details screen here.

02:52.760 --> 03:00.350
So as an exercise, I want you to see how can we then get all of the information about this movie?

03:01.100 --> 03:03.980
Click we're getting the idea of the movie.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.690
So what do you need to do?

03:05.750 --> 03:10.100
I'll give you a hint here is to filter through the movie.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.530
This list of movie get movies filter through until you find something.

03:15.830 --> 03:21.380
Until you find a movie from release that contains that ad, which, Heidi, it's going to be this ID

03:21.740 --> 03:22.610
that we see.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.680
Actually, that we see here.

03:27.070 --> 03:34.690
Because that's been passed onto the screen so you can use the filter to filter through the list of movies

03:34.960 --> 03:39.670
to find this particular movie and then get information about that movie.

03:40.910 --> 03:44.410
I had to spend some time trying to figure that out, and I'll see you in a nice video.

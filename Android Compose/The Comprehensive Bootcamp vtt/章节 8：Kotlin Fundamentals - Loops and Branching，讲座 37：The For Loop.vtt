00:00.390 --> 00:06.750
Now, let's imagine that we were given a task, the task is to look through or, in this case, go through

00:06.780 --> 00:10.110
a range of numbers, let's say, between one and a thousand.

00:10.140 --> 00:16.080
And as we go through this range of a number, we need to find all numbers are a multiple of two or three

00:16.080 --> 00:17.070
or 10 or so forth.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.570
Let's start with multiple of three, which means that these numbers are divisible by three and that

00:21.570 --> 00:24.210
the remainder is going to be zero if they're divisible by three, right?

00:24.360 --> 00:26.130
So how do we go about doing that?

00:26.250 --> 00:30.290
Well, from what do we know so far, we could use an if statement right?

00:30.390 --> 00:37.890
We can say if one is divisible by three and the remainder is zero, then that number should be printed.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.930
Next one and if else to is divisible by three and go so forth, right?

00:43.080 --> 00:45.060
Or we can use a when expression.

00:45.600 --> 00:51.120
Remember, in computing, really, we are trying to manipulate data and we have certain tools available

00:51.120 --> 00:56.250
to us, one of which is we saw these conditions, which is branching and so forth.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.640
But there's another one if we want to repeat certain task.

00:59.640 --> 01:05.490
In this case, we are repeating this iteration process of going through certain range of numbers and

01:05.490 --> 01:06.240
finding things.

01:06.390 --> 01:06.660
OK.

01:06.990 --> 01:10.470
So there is indeed such structure called a for loop.

01:10.710 --> 01:14.050
So for a loop is one of the most powerful structures in your programs.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.750
So how do we set up that?

01:15.900 --> 01:17.010
Well, we say for that.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.110
You can see our IDs going to help us.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.410
If you enter, then you can see now inside of practices.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.840
We can pass the expression inside there.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.760
So what is that we want to to do?

01:26.970 --> 01:29.820
For starters, we want to say something like this.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.690
We want to say I n and we give the range.

01:32.700 --> 01:39.210
If I say one dot dot with C three and then inside of this code block here I can say print.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.810
I, for instance, OK, just a quick example here.

01:41.820 --> 01:46.000
So what's going to happen here is that it's for a loop is going to go ahead and look at this range.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.300
I'm going to say OK as I go through from between one three, I'm going to print that I c, which means

01:51.300 --> 01:54.360
this is actually going to be the counter between one and three.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.890
Let's run and see what's going to happen, right?

01:56.910 --> 01:58.380
Says one two three.

01:58.410 --> 02:03.720
Now, if I want it, I could say print l n to put all of them in a different line.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.710
Go ahead and run.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.900
And you can see one two three.

02:07.050 --> 02:07.870
OK, very good.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.340
So that is this simple for loop here.

02:10.350 --> 02:15.050
So we have here the eye, which is in this case is the counter or the index in this case.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.380
And then we have the range.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.780
So as we go through this looping through goes through, it's going to go ahead and print the eye, which

02:21.780 --> 02:28.770
in this case is the counter index as we go first time, the one second time to third time and so forth.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.380
That's why we see between one two three there.

02:31.830 --> 02:32.550
OK, very good.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.980
Now onto our exercise.

02:35.190 --> 02:41.040
First of all, we want to go through or loop through a range of numbers, say, between one and 1000,

02:41.040 --> 02:43.770
so I can see just changes to 1000 like this.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.170
OK.

02:44.190 --> 02:48.210
So if I go ahead and run, we should go through one to one and 1000.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.790
There we go very fast, depending on your computer speed.

02:50.910 --> 02:52.830
This will be really fast or a little bit slow.

02:53.160 --> 02:53.490
OK.

02:53.730 --> 02:54.060
There we go.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.300
So but next we done the first part take.

02:56.310 --> 03:01.620
The next part is we need to check to see if the numbers as we loop through.

03:01.770 --> 03:07.500
There are any numbers that are divisible by three or multiples of three divisible by three or multiples

03:07.500 --> 03:07.950
of three.

03:08.130 --> 03:08.630
Same thing.

03:08.940 --> 03:09.480
What do we do?

03:09.510 --> 03:10.320
Well, think about it.

03:10.320 --> 03:16.680
We can put inside an if statement right and see if right I now, how do we check if something is divisible

03:16.680 --> 03:17.520
by something?

03:17.550 --> 03:20.880
Well, we use the modulo operator we saw earlier.

03:20.970 --> 03:23.310
I can say then percentage sign.

03:23.550 --> 03:27.720
I want to see if it's divisible by three or if it's multiple of three.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.510
I can see three is equal to zero.

03:30.630 --> 03:36.300
What I'm saying here is that each number as we go through is going to check OK, if that number is divisible

03:36.300 --> 03:40.300
by three and we know it's divisible by three, when it's divisible by three.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.870
If there no remainder.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.860
So if remainder, once we divide it by three is zero, then that number is divisible by three.

03:46.980 --> 03:47.340
OK.

03:47.490 --> 03:53.340
So in this case, I can actually put in one line or I can put like this because it's just one statement

03:53.490 --> 03:54.660
right after the if statement.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.230
So that works.

03:55.230 --> 03:58.960
I don't have to put in half a block code block their curly braces.

03:58.980 --> 03:59.820
This works as well.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.890
Or, like I said, it can simplify this.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.950
Put this in one line like this.

04:03.990 --> 04:09.870
So what I want to print well, I want to print a message that says, I this number that we're showing

04:09.870 --> 04:13.590
at this point, this index is multiple of three.

04:13.860 --> 04:14.580
It's going to run.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.300
There we go.

04:15.330 --> 04:18.210
So now we can see that indeed, this is working.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.750
Three is the is indeed a multiple of three six.

04:20.750 --> 04:26.110
It's multiple three, nine and so forth all the way to nine hundred ninety nine.

04:26.630 --> 04:26.910
Right.

04:26.970 --> 04:31.640
And if I want, I can say else just print something that says like this.

04:31.650 --> 04:35.790
So for any other number that it's not multiple of three, we're just going to have three dashes like

04:35.790 --> 04:36.030
that.

04:36.130 --> 04:36.480
Let's see.

04:37.020 --> 04:37.350
OK.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.710
So 981 is not multiple of three.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.440
Or actually, let's see this say print airline so that it doesn't pollute our structure there because

04:46.440 --> 04:47.430
that it's very confusing.

04:47.910 --> 04:48.210
OK.

04:48.240 --> 04:48.660
There we go.

04:48.750 --> 04:54.090
So for every dashes you see, so we have one and two, there are not three.

04:54.090 --> 04:59.580
That's why they have Dash, Dash and then we have four and five have seven and eight.

04:59.860 --> 05:00.370
So forth.

05:00.940 --> 05:02.050
All right, so there you have it.

05:02.230 --> 05:07.900
So this is very powerful, as you can see, because we can put any range here and we can use if statements

05:08.020 --> 05:10.060
to control the flow of our program.

05:10.150 --> 05:10.390
Right.

05:10.540 --> 05:14.770
So at this point, you can start seeing the power that we have here right now.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.700
This is the most simplistic way of showing for a loop.

05:18.700 --> 05:22.960
And if statement together, they can start looking at other things you can do.

05:23.410 --> 05:30.670
You can present check if that number is multiple three and or if that number is an odd number and go

05:30.670 --> 05:31.120
from there.

05:31.310 --> 05:31.570
Right.

05:31.750 --> 05:37.750
So think of other cases that you can actually check with an if statement if you want, you can also

05:37.750 --> 05:40.180
use a one that works totally fine as well.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.020
OK.

05:41.110 --> 05:42.070
I hope you're getting cited.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.060
This is this is really cool.

05:43.090 --> 05:43.720
It's really cool.

05:43.780 --> 05:44.100
All right.

05:44.110 --> 05:44.830
See you next time.

00:00.390 --> 00:08.910
So let's focus on adding the actual info about this particular developer, OK, so name and other text,

00:09.420 --> 00:14.190
and I'm sure you were able to get that done because I know how dedicated and smart you are.

00:14.580 --> 00:15.030
OK.

00:15.330 --> 00:15.690
All right.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.530
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.270
So after the fighter, as you see, there it is.

00:19.290 --> 00:24.900
We are going to add another composable, which is a piece of UI real estate, as I like to call it.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.150
Now let's think about this again.

00:27.330 --> 00:34.590
All of this area here will have all of its items laid out vertically, which means also we may think

00:34.590 --> 00:35.580
about a column.

00:35.700 --> 00:40.380
OK, because a column, as we've seen earlier, will lay things out vertically.

00:40.770 --> 00:45.150
Now we could get away with just adding them as they are right now.

00:45.150 --> 00:48.450
But I like to create little entities, little factories.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.580
They can exist by themselves.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.470
So here I'm going to say column.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.960
I such in the column.

00:55.260 --> 00:59.490
And let's add a modifier and say modifier.

00:59.820 --> 01:04.110
I want the padding overall pattern of about five dpi as such.

01:04.350 --> 01:04.650
All right.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.050
So now we're going to add to the text, right?

01:07.050 --> 01:11.820
This text here that we see in the square and see how can we accomplish that?

01:11.970 --> 01:14.250
Let's go just to code so we can see everything for now.

01:15.300 --> 01:20.700
Well, simply when I say, text this OK, the first option and I'm going to pass something that's a

01:20.700 --> 01:28.500
miles P. As such now, because like anything else that we've seen before, a composable allows us to

01:28.500 --> 01:33.120
pass modifiers, allows us to pass other parameters so we can customize.

01:33.330 --> 01:35.580
These composable, in this case, is a text.

01:35.940 --> 01:41.520
OK, if you hover over, you can see there's all sort of parameters we can pass to modify and customize

01:41.520 --> 01:41.970
our text.

01:42.120 --> 01:49.370
That is indeed the beauty of compose is that we can take anything and start passing all of these parameters

01:49.440 --> 01:51.780
so we can modify the composable.

01:52.020 --> 01:52.590
Very neat.

01:52.890 --> 01:54.090
So what do you want to do first?

01:54.120 --> 01:56.160
Well, we want to pass in a style.

01:56.170 --> 02:02.100
So when I say comma in say style as such and for the style, it cannot pass a textile type.

02:02.100 --> 02:08.820
Or I can continue the trend by saying material theme and go and get typography.

02:08.910 --> 02:10.860
And then I want each force.

02:10.860 --> 02:16.450
So each one is the larger size you can pick and the higher the number, the less the size.

02:16.470 --> 02:22.590
So in this case, I just want kind of a medium there for then still inside of our text there, and we're

02:22.590 --> 02:26.070
passing these parameters so that we can customize our text.

02:26.370 --> 02:28.260
I'm going to give it color scheme with a color.

02:28.470 --> 02:32.100
I can pass a color object, but I'm going to use material again.

02:32.550 --> 02:37.890
Theme one Colors and I'm going to say primary variance.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.990
I can choose from all of this.

02:40.050 --> 02:40.320
OK.

02:40.710 --> 02:41.340
All right, there we go.

02:41.550 --> 02:42.420
There's our text.

02:42.690 --> 02:48.150
Now, if we go back to sleep mode so we can see, let's go ahead and refresh this real quick.

02:48.570 --> 02:52.170
And you can see we have Myles P. looking really good.

02:52.200 --> 02:52.560
Very good.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.550
So now what else can we do here?

02:54.570 --> 03:00.480
Well, I can do the same thing that we did with create image profile so we can refactor everything right

03:01.140 --> 03:03.750
before we do that, let's continue because there are the things we need to add.

03:03.870 --> 03:07.290
As you see here, we have this piece of text and more.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.240
So next, I'm going to add another text.

03:09.780 --> 03:11.820
This one will say whatever you want to say.

03:11.820 --> 03:14.370
Android compose programmer.

03:14.700 --> 03:21.420
There's added modifier for voice and I want padding all to be three that deep.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.340
And that's fine.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.750
And let's just get the same another one at the bottom, and this one is going to be something like at

03:31.310 --> 03:32.520
least miles.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.240
Of course, you can put whatever you want.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.250
This is just an example.

03:35.610 --> 03:41.420
And now for this one modifier, we are going to do the same thing as we did before, but we also are

03:41.430 --> 03:44.010
going to add something else in our style.

03:44.190 --> 03:52.430
Still inside of our text, their was style material, theme typography, and I'm going to use the subtitle

03:52.440 --> 03:55.170
a subtitle to subtitle one one is fine.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.320
All right, let's go ahead and update, build and refresh.

03:58.980 --> 03:59.520
And voila!

04:00.330 --> 04:03.160
And as you can see, it's looking really good, right?

04:03.180 --> 04:07.140
We have our image, our profile image when we have our text.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.510
So it's really getting to look like this.

04:09.930 --> 04:14.430
Now, one thing we haven't done in a while is we haven't really looked to see how this will look on

04:14.430 --> 04:16.240
a device in this case on emulators.

04:16.260 --> 04:17.970
Go ahead and run real quick.

04:18.330 --> 04:20.760
This whole app to see how it will look like.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.660
And there you have it.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.900
It's looking really good.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.410
We have everything perfectly fine.

04:26.440 --> 04:30.730
OK, so one more thing we need to do is to add this portfolio button.

04:30.910 --> 04:34.420
But before we do that, let's go ahead and refactor this column here.

04:34.510 --> 04:37.960
So I'm going to just click there and select everything.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.400
Right click.

04:39.580 --> 04:43.330
And let's go to refactor function in this name.

04:43.340 --> 04:50.800
This create info such and you can see you now have another composable, which is just a little piece

04:51.040 --> 04:53.950
that is not attached to the main card here.

04:54.220 --> 04:54.550
All right.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.440
So now just calling it a session.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.330
So we're making real good progress, as I said.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.260
Next thing we're going to do is to create this button here.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.540
In fact, as a little exercise, it can do this.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.000
How would you create a button like this?

05:07.480 --> 05:10.120
Go ahead and try to figure out, and I'll see you in next video.

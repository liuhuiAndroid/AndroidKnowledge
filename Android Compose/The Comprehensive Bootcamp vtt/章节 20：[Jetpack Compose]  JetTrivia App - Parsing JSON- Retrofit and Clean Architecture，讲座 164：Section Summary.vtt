All right, so we learn a lot in this section, we built a trivia app from scratch.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.420
There's a lot of moving parts.

00:07.920 --> 00:15.180
We learn about clean architecture, how to further set up our apps for success in many ways.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.980
And we also learn about how to price data.

00:19.260 --> 00:24.300
Jason data, of course, using retrofit library and other libraries that come with it.

00:25.260 --> 00:30.690
And of course, we improved our user interface design using compose.

00:31.140 --> 00:37.260
Now, this is not a final application, meaning there are a lot of things you can do and add to it to

00:37.260 --> 00:40.290
make it your own and improve upon it as an exercise.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.510
So that's what I would recommend you do.

00:43.020 --> 00:49.380
But for now, thank you so much for your time, and I hope you learned something from this section and

00:49.380 --> 00:55.980
I hope that you, if anything, you got inspired to go out there and learn more about compose and how

00:55.980 --> 00:57.570
to build awesome apps.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.480
Very well, thank you, and I'll see you next time.

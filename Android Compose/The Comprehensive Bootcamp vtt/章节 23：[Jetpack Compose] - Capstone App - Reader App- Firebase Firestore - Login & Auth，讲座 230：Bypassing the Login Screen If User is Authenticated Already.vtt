00:00.540 --> 00:07.680
One thing you'll notice is that every time you run this app, as it is right now, we always go through

00:07.680 --> 00:13.080
the same process, which is we have the splash screen and then a few seconds later we go to log in a

00:13.080 --> 00:18.810
log out, log in or create account, right, which is fine because we were putting this together.

00:18.810 --> 00:26.190
But at some point, obviously, if you ship this app and people are using this app, it will be annoying

00:26.190 --> 00:29.310
to always having to go through the process of logging in.

00:29.310 --> 00:38.130
And there is a way that allows us to get rid of this whole process of going through the screens that

00:38.130 --> 00:43.620
are not needed anymore because we have created accounts and we just want to go straight to home screen.

00:44.340 --> 00:50.940
So what we can do now is let's go to our splash screen splash screen.

00:50.940 --> 00:51.480
Let's see.

00:54.660 --> 00:58.780
This and we can put an if statement, but where is that going to be?

00:58.800 --> 01:07.620
So if we go back to where we have a watched effect there and after our delay right here, we see we

01:07.620 --> 01:13.500
have this to do actually check if there is a Facebook groups that Facebook should say, Firebase, if

01:13.500 --> 01:14.880
there's a Firebase user.

01:14.910 --> 01:17.640
If so, take them to homescreen otherwise to log in.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.060
All right.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.030
So how do we check if there is a Firebase user?

01:21.060 --> 01:26.640
Well, the beauty here is that because Firebase, we have added Firebase to our project.

01:26.910 --> 01:35.820
We have a way to get Firebase off object right to check things out, to say if statement.

01:35.820 --> 01:45.780
He put an if statement when say if Firebase Auth get that one there that get instance.

01:47.430 --> 02:02.100
And I can say, look for the current user, look at that and email is null or empty, right then.

02:02.130 --> 02:05.400
If that's the case, we are going to go to nav controller.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.270
We're going to use nav controller that is and go to navigate.

02:11.130 --> 02:12.540
We're going to get the right one.

02:12.540 --> 02:13.260
We want the.

02:16.290 --> 02:20.670
The route you can't quite see there, we see the route one, the bottom there.

02:20.790 --> 02:21.080
OK.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.820
And let's say leaders scream.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.660
Let's go to log in screen that name.

02:28.410 --> 02:28.710
OK.

02:29.370 --> 02:33.750
And we'll have to wrap this this way.

02:34.170 --> 02:34.500
OK.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.440
There it is else.

02:36.750 --> 02:40.680
Well, we know that there is indeed a user already logged in.

02:41.190 --> 02:43.960
We're just going to go ahead and say NAV control again.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.540
Navigate.

02:45.690 --> 02:46.980
Let's get the correct one.

02:46.980 --> 02:48.590
Otherwise we'll run into issues here.

02:48.740 --> 02:50.850
I repeat myself here, it's crucial.

02:51.450 --> 02:59.430
And when I say readers screen again, we're going to go to reader home screen like this.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.850
Just this piece of code is going to change everything.

03:03.810 --> 03:04.110
All right.

03:04.110 --> 03:08.580
So I have the problem here is that I still have this navigate to log in screen.

03:08.580 --> 03:12.510
So this must get out of here because we don't need that.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.520
So now what is going to happen?

03:14.520 --> 03:16.620
We still going to have this animation happening.

03:16.890 --> 03:24.690
But if we have a a user, then it's going to go straight to read reader home instead of going to these

03:24.780 --> 03:25.560
screens here.

03:26.010 --> 03:26.310
All right.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.590
Let's go ahead and run once again.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.870
And we should go straight to home like that.

03:35.110 --> 03:36.030
All right, so there we go.

03:36.040 --> 03:42.790
So this is how we bypass these two screens so that users don't have to go through this process again

03:43.030 --> 03:47.440
if they indeed already have created account and they have locked in.

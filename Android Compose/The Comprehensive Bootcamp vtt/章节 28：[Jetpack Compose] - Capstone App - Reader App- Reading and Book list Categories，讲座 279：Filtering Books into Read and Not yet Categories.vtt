WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:05.490
So even though we were able to update and add books and delete into all sorts of things in our main

00:05.490 --> 00:08.970
screen here, we still have all the books being shown.

00:08.980 --> 00:15.390
So this book here, if you click, looks like they started reading on November six, yet it's still

00:15.690 --> 00:19.800
in our reading list, so we want to add it to our reading now.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.640
And of course, this is showing here because it's the same thing, right?

00:23.940 --> 00:27.240
So we want to structure this a little bit differently.

00:27.930 --> 00:35.910
So how do we make it so that if the book in this case has been started right, we want to show it here.

00:35.970 --> 00:39.570
And if a book was just added, they will be shown around here.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.670
And if the book is finished being read, then we're going to put it somewhere else.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.910
Okay, let's start with restructuring this area here.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.220
Let's go back to our reader home screen.

00:50.550 --> 00:56.420
That's where the magic happens, and we need to go and find our book list area.

00:56.430 --> 01:01.330
Let's go and say Command F. Book List Area.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.070
Let's see.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.260
Well, OK.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.700
So we have a horizontal.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.040
I call it bull.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.930
That's why it's going to be book.

01:09.930 --> 01:12.570
So let's go ahead and refactor this.

01:15.340 --> 01:20.590
It's going to be a book list area like this.

01:22.460 --> 01:27.650
All right, so what do you want to do here because we see that we have a list of books, so this list

01:27.650 --> 01:31.490
of books is just going to be the list of all the books that we have in our database.

01:31.910 --> 01:32.210
OK?

01:32.960 --> 01:33.780
Which is OK.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.390
That's not what we want right now.

01:36.260 --> 01:44.480
What do we need to do is to cipher through this list before we pass it along to be fed in our Aurizon

01:44.480 --> 01:45.900
or scribble here.

01:46.910 --> 01:47.720
So how do we do that?

01:47.750 --> 01:54.920
Well, I'm just going to create a separate variable here called added books, because assuming these

01:54.920 --> 02:00.800
books were just added right, and then I'm going to use all of this book list that is OK.

02:02.070 --> 02:09.160
A list of books they were receiving when a filter and here I'm going to pass a book or an ebook in this

02:09.180 --> 02:17.790
case, and I'm going to pass the predicate, so I'm going to say if a book or any book that is that

02:17.790 --> 02:28.770
starting reading started reading is null and book that finished M book that is that finished reading

02:29.250 --> 02:30.120
is null.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.680
It makes sense what I'm saying here.

02:32.070 --> 02:37.770
All I want to filter through find all the books that started reading is now, meaning they haven't started.

02:38.130 --> 02:39.930
They haven't started reading the book.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.210
And also finished reading is no.

02:42.510 --> 02:47.250
So this will tell me that this book is a new book that was just added, which is the kind of book that

02:47.250 --> 02:51.960
I want to pass along now because this horizontal scrollable component is being called.

02:52.170 --> 02:56.400
Also, you know, reading now area, right?

02:56.400 --> 02:57.750
Because we passing the same thing.

02:58.260 --> 03:03.570
Now I'm going to go inside there and change a few things so that we separate this even further.

03:03.810 --> 03:07.350
What I can also what I'm also going to do, I'm going to pass a view model.

03:07.350 --> 03:10.020
Home screen view model can be helped.

03:11.430 --> 03:14.760
If you model such, I'm going to be using that just to check a few things.

03:15.060 --> 03:21.480
So here is where we can getting those books and passing in and sort of our card pressed into all the

03:21.480 --> 03:22.380
things that we've seen.

03:22.890 --> 03:29.520
Now what I'm going to do here, I'm going to put an if statement to say, if you model that data that

03:29.520 --> 03:37.260
value and get loading state, if it's true, then what I'm going to do, then I'm going to sit and else

03:37.410 --> 03:37.800
there.

03:38.970 --> 03:45.180
If that is true, then here I'm going to say linear progress indicator else.

03:45.810 --> 03:50.490
Check first if our books or list of books in this case.

03:53.140 --> 03:56.020
Is null or empty?

03:57.700 --> 04:01.390
I'm going to pass a little message here, so I'm going to create a surface.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.390
And this special modifier.

04:07.490 --> 04:10.600
Padding about 23 deep.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.380
Then I'm going to add text.

04:15.270 --> 04:23.640
That will say no books found at a book, let's add a little styling as well.

04:26.690 --> 04:28.850
It's a text style.

04:32.160 --> 04:45.360
Right, give it color that red passing the alpha or copy first pass the alpha of about zero point four.

04:45.370 --> 04:49.600
So it's kind of -- red in the -- font weight.

04:49.870 --> 04:58.570
I'm going to add a bold font weight, and let's give a font size of about 14 sb.

04:59.950 --> 05:01.780
So that's inside of this if statement.

05:01.780 --> 05:05.950
And then I'm going to add in an else inside there else.

05:05.980 --> 05:09.070
That's when we get to show all of the books.

05:09.460 --> 05:12.550
It's going to cut all of this and put inside there.

05:12.730 --> 05:18.940
So we've taken care of this book list area, which is this this area here now?

05:18.940 --> 05:22.720
And it's take care of this category where the books are being read.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.300
So it's going to be reading now, let's just go there.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.440
We're going to do the same thing, which is I'm going to filter.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.380
Books by reading now.

05:36.080 --> 05:36.860
How do we do that?

05:36.890 --> 05:38.060
Well, I'm going to say, Val.

05:39.070 --> 05:45.550
Put this reading now, list variable and when to use the list of books that we're getting there.

05:46.900 --> 05:56.650
And I'm going to say filter like what we did before and book like this and then I'm going to check if

05:56.650 --> 05:59.350
an ebook started reading.

05:59.530 --> 06:02.140
It's not know, right?

06:04.670 --> 06:07.060
And book that is not finished.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.700
Reading is not right.

06:09.910 --> 06:15.490
So the idea is that, well, this study of reading shouldn't be null because that tells us this.

06:15.700 --> 06:22.240
They have started reading this book and also want to be sure that finished reading property is novel

06:22.240 --> 06:26.530
because they haven't they haven't finished reading this book, which exactly is what we want.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.090
So this is the list.

06:28.120 --> 06:35.170
Now we're going to pass along here to our horizontal scroll book component to be shown.

06:35.530 --> 06:42.100
You can see how easy all this seems now because we've put together that structure of the database,

06:42.100 --> 06:43.090
that books and everything.

06:43.690 --> 06:46.690
So all we do is just get the data we have the state.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.490
It's got everything that we need.

06:48.550 --> 06:55.750
Now we can just start manipulating, filtering and trying to categorize all of the books into different

06:55.960 --> 06:56.620
categories.

06:58.090 --> 06:58.400
Right.

06:58.420 --> 07:04.900
So let's go ahead and run this real quick so we can see how fluid and make any mistakes and see how

07:04.900 --> 07:05.770
this will look.

07:07.870 --> 07:08.320
Aha!

07:08.560 --> 07:11.260
And you saw there there was that very nice loading.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.070
And that's very good.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.390
And here we are.

07:13.780 --> 07:18.850
So it seems like this is working because this book, if you click, well, nothing is going to happen

07:18.850 --> 07:23.830
because we haven't added a click ability to click event to this yet.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.960
To this top, we'll get there.

07:26.290 --> 07:30.940
So this tells us that this flatter in action it's being read right now.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.740
If you go back here, you can click click this one, OK?

07:36.430 --> 07:37.930
You will see that this.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.710
Finish reading at is no, which is exactly right.

07:41.800 --> 07:46.300
They haven't finished, so that means they're reading because says he has started reading or started

07:46.300 --> 07:47.590
reading at that date.

07:49.070 --> 07:49.400
OK.

07:49.670 --> 07:54.680
And the other book, because we only have two books, the other book, it's going to be at the bottom

07:54.680 --> 08:00.560
list right at the reading list because first of all, they started reading is not because they haven't

08:00.560 --> 08:00.980
started.

08:01.790 --> 08:04.760
And if that's the case, then of course, that book is going to be at the bottom.

08:04.940 --> 08:06.320
If I change this, look at this.

08:06.590 --> 08:10.340
If I just give a rating and start reading an update, we go back.

08:10.380 --> 08:10.790
Voila!

08:10.940 --> 08:16.940
You can see now reading list is empty because there are no books found because we changed this other

08:16.940 --> 08:21.950
one to reading because now we're reading, so it's filtered here.

08:22.280 --> 08:28.250
If I go ahead and add the new book because we can still search wonderful boxing, because that's what

08:28.250 --> 08:31.130
I'm going to learn from now on.

08:31.670 --> 08:34.760
OK, let's take that book and let's save.

08:35.900 --> 08:36.470
Go home.

08:36.960 --> 08:42.540
I love it's showing here because we haven't started reading it or anything, we just added it great.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.280
So it's working.

08:43.520 --> 08:49.640
Now the other thing we need to do is to change the the wording here, because here's your says reading,

08:49.640 --> 08:50.840
which makes sense.

08:51.650 --> 08:55.490
But here we want to change to something else, maybe saying not ready yet.

08:55.500 --> 09:00.380
But before we do that, let's make it so that we can navigate in this reading right now because we don't

09:00.380 --> 09:01.220
have anything yet.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.270
We have this to do.

09:03.050 --> 09:09.630
Let's navigate to that with enough controller to the update screen that is navigate.

09:10.340 --> 09:13.430
Get the route over the years.

09:13.820 --> 09:21.870
Screen's going to update that name and remember, we need to pass that value.

09:21.890 --> 09:22.370
Yes.

09:22.670 --> 09:25.640
So I'm going to say forward slash.

09:26.010 --> 09:30.140
So this is exactly what we did with this other area.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.320
Remember, same thing.

09:31.340 --> 09:34.010
So just take them to the update screen.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.270
So now both of them.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.390
Let's go ahead and Brian real quick so we can see what I'm talking about.

09:39.590 --> 09:41.690
OK, now if I click on this, I should go.

09:42.020 --> 09:49.370
Just like we did before to the update screen and here I'm good Mac marked as red and say something like

09:50.030 --> 09:50.810
wonderful.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.050
And let's go ahead and update go back.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.910
You notice that we don't see that book anymore.

09:56.300 --> 10:01.400
That's good because that is the logic, because it we've read that book and life is good and we'll we'll

10:01.400 --> 10:05.630
we'll get that book at some point at show in the stats screen, but a lot.

10:05.630 --> 10:06.410
So it's working.

10:06.560 --> 10:12.260
Now let's look at changing this reading and this text here, right at the bottom here.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.150
We're not reading this.

10:13.190 --> 10:17.690
We just added, maybe we could say just added perhaps something like that, right?

10:17.870 --> 10:22.190
But here it's fine reading, because that's what we're doing these books that what are we doing with

10:22.190 --> 10:22.370
them?

10:23.650 --> 10:24.610
OK, let's take a look.

10:25.240 --> 10:32.440
All right, so let's click on our horizontal and then go there, we want to go to the actual list card

10:32.440 --> 10:34.600
because that's where the magic happens.

10:34.600 --> 10:41.470
That's where we can see this list card there and we're going to scroll down to see it, says Reading.

10:41.470 --> 10:44.920
So this is this text, so we want to change that.

10:46.060 --> 10:55.540
So first of all, I'm going to create a state here and say, file is started reading, say, remember

10:56.290 --> 11:01.420
and mutable state of false.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.560
So it's going to be Boolean.

11:02.890 --> 11:03.970
That's exactly what we want.

11:04.210 --> 11:04.510
OK.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.390
Say is started reading that value.

11:08.950 --> 11:11.490
I'm going to set that to what?

11:11.500 --> 11:15.340
Well, I'm going to get the book started reading.

11:17.180 --> 11:18.370
Is not no.

11:19.790 --> 11:26.030
So what I'm saying here is, well, I'm going to get the value, whether this is started or not by looking

11:26.030 --> 11:29.000
at the book started reading property.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.520
If it's no that's true, then this is true.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.140
That, I mean, start reading is true.

11:34.490 --> 11:38.090
So depending on that, then I'm going to change the text.

11:38.570 --> 11:39.620
What he will say here?

11:40.010 --> 11:46.880
Put a end in line if statement here, I'm going to say if he started reading that value is true, it

11:46.880 --> 11:47.800
just leave as it is.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.720
I'm going to say he's reading like that is fine.

11:50.990 --> 11:58.490
Else, the text is going to say White not started like this.

11:58.820 --> 12:00.710
Let's save this and give it a run.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.910
And you can see it says they're not started.

12:07.040 --> 12:07.220
Right.

12:07.250 --> 12:13.730
It looks like it's pretty crammed in there instead here that started just changed the do something less

12:14.420 --> 12:14.930
long.

12:14.990 --> 12:17.450
Of course, you can readjust as you wish to do.

12:17.630 --> 12:21.110
I can say not say just let's just say not yet.

12:21.830 --> 12:22.790
Sure, that's fine.

12:22.930 --> 12:23.450
Doesn't matter.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.870
And you can see says not yet.

12:27.350 --> 12:27.910
All right.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.450
So this is working.

12:30.020 --> 12:36.410
And of course, if I get started and update, this is going to be empty because now we've started that

12:36.500 --> 12:37.550
book also.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.480
All right, coming together.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.220
All right, so the next thing we need to do to finalize everything is to make sure that when we click

12:46.090 --> 12:50.750
there, we can go to that screen and we can show the stats in this case.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.110
How many books have been read and so forth?

12:53.800 --> 12:54.120
All right.

12:54.130 --> 12:54.940
Let's go ahead and do that.

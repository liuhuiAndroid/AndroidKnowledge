00:01.170 --> 00:06.350
All right, so before we go into adding notes and notes, let's go ahead and see if we can add or at

00:06.350 --> 00:11.480
least be able to see some sort of dummy data showing at the bottom because we have data source.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.790
Let's use that.

00:12.830 --> 00:16.190
But before we do that, of course, we need to have that infrastructure right, which is going to be

00:16.190 --> 00:17.330
at the bottom somewhere.

00:18.530 --> 00:21.770
Bottom of the button, I'm going to have this list.

00:25.670 --> 00:31.340
So right there after that scope there, just put enter.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.850
First of all, I'm going to add it a fighter because I need that nice divider.

00:35.630 --> 00:38.810
And let's give put a modifier here.

00:40.520 --> 00:44.270
I want padding about 10 deep.

00:46.840 --> 00:54.340
And then let's add a lazy column, because that's what we use to load a list of items.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.610
OK, let's use that to move our past items.

00:57.730 --> 01:00.130
In this case, make sure you pick the correct one.

01:00.550 --> 01:07.570
I'm going to use these this items items list there, and I'm going to pass what and when I pass notes

01:08.380 --> 01:12.490
list there and another lambda say note.

01:13.210 --> 01:15.940
And here, for now, I'm just going to say text and pass.

01:16.150 --> 01:24.250
They note that title because this note is going to be an object, whereas this note's coming from,

01:24.610 --> 01:28.690
well, we should be passing along in notes screen.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.860
So whatever this is called, we're going to pass that notes list and voila.

01:34.000 --> 01:42.160
So because I know I have at the bottom here in this note screen preview, I can actually pass that source

01:42.160 --> 01:51.610
of data notes that are source and then I'm going to get the load notes as such should go ahead and split

01:51.760 --> 01:52.270
this.

01:52.330 --> 01:53.800
Let's go ahead and refresh.

01:55.180 --> 02:02.860
And voila, you can see now we have our list of those notes dummy data I get.

02:03.070 --> 02:06.760
Obviously, that's not what we're going for, but at least we know things are working.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.600
At least we're able to get information, get the data that we want.

02:11.830 --> 02:12.210
OK.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.540
This is exciting.

02:14.170 --> 02:18.970
Now, if you want to run this actually to see something, we need to go back to remain active because

02:18.970 --> 02:23.200
remember, this is what it's called when we actually run into see on the screen.

02:23.590 --> 02:23.860
All right.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.360
So this is a mistake.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.370
We all make notes.

02:28.090 --> 02:32.080
Data source and load notes.

02:32.590 --> 02:33.370
Let's go ahead and run.

02:35.610 --> 02:36.300
And there you have it.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.740
We have the same thing we saw, but at least now we know that things are working.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.420
OK, so back to our code, let's get rid of that now.

02:46.470 --> 02:51.840
This is not what we're going for, so we need to add some sort of a role that it looks nice, something

02:51.840 --> 02:52.290
like this.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.420
Nothing out of this world, but something nice.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.810
So at the bottom here, I'm going to create another function.

02:58.440 --> 03:09.930
So at composable, it's a function and it's going to be a note row and I'm going to pass the modifier

03:09.930 --> 03:15.360
because we should always do this an optional one that I'm going to be passing.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.400
And it's finalized like that.

03:18.060 --> 03:18.360
Good.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.580
And let's pass the note, right?

03:22.620 --> 03:23.580
We actually need to note.

03:24.060 --> 03:32.310
We can show it's going to be a note object type and add on note clicked because we want to make sure

03:32.310 --> 03:36.330
that when we click each row, something happens.

03:36.330 --> 03:41.210
I'm going to pass the note object so we can do whatever we want to do with it.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.330
So you need to like that.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.250
OK, I hope this is making sense.

03:45.670 --> 03:51.550
So we always passing the responsibility policy to the calling function.

03:52.540 --> 03:52.840
All right.

03:52.990 --> 03:53.650
So there we go.

03:53.890 --> 03:55.120
So what I want to do here?

03:55.210 --> 03:59.410
I'm just going to start putting a surface that always helps.

04:00.620 --> 04:01.990
Yeah, modifier.

04:01.990 --> 04:08.110
I'm going to use the modifier we're passing, so we customize things the right way for dpi all around.

04:09.010 --> 04:13.030
And then what I want to do, I'm going to use the clip function here.

04:13.030 --> 04:16.750
What this that is is going to allow us to clip using a shape.

04:17.110 --> 04:22.150
And then here I'm going to see I want to clip it with the rounded corners shape.

04:23.080 --> 04:27.370
And the beauty here is just I can't specify the size that I want to clip.

04:27.820 --> 04:34.150
If you look closely, you can see that I only clipped the top end like that, right?

04:34.870 --> 04:36.460
So I can say top end.

04:36.580 --> 04:42.370
I want to clipped by three dpi and then the bottom.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.620
And if I need to, I can do.

04:44.710 --> 04:50.080
Or let's say, bottom start just to be dramatic here by the same three dpi.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.180
Very cool.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.250
And then I'm going to say that.

04:55.770 --> 04:56.910
Feel Max width.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.200
Let's give it.

04:59.970 --> 05:00.660
Color.

05:01.930 --> 05:02.920
Let's say, Carla.

05:03.850 --> 05:07.030
This is going to be the color for the entire surface.

05:08.470 --> 05:14.170
So I'm going to say zero x and f f the f e.

05:16.330 --> 05:17.230
And six.

05:19.330 --> 05:25.510
eBay, again, you can change by clicking once you have that hex, you can come click on the gutter

05:25.510 --> 05:28.240
and change to your color, but that's that that looks good.

05:28.540 --> 05:34.090
Before I even go in for, let's also add elevation what 60p?

05:34.240 --> 05:37.930
So next, I'm going to add a column such.

05:39.400 --> 05:46.900
And for this column here, I'm going to say a modifier, and I'm going to make this clickable because

05:46.900 --> 05:48.670
I need that click event.

05:48.910 --> 05:49.750
We'll see later.

05:50.140 --> 05:52.540
And I want to also give a padding.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.430
Say horizontal.

05:58.130 --> 06:05.030
Of about 14 deep and vertical padding of about six deep.

06:07.530 --> 06:15.630
And continuing here, what I want to do is I want to say horizontal alignment alignment is going to

06:15.630 --> 06:17.640
be start all the way to the right.

06:18.420 --> 06:18.740
OK.

06:19.650 --> 06:22.590
And now I'm just going to have fun by putting text.

06:23.910 --> 06:29.820
The first text I'm going to add here is going to be the note that title.

06:31.170 --> 06:37.850
And let's put a style, I'm going to use material theme topography.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.840
Subtitle one, actually, two,

06:46.440 --> 06:47.820
then another text.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.200
There's going to be note description.

06:57.750 --> 07:03.720
Give it a style like this, and the last one is going to be.

07:04.500 --> 07:09.480
Note, I want the entry date now for the entry date here.

07:10.050 --> 07:14.010
I can do more because it will come in as gibberish.

07:14.220 --> 07:14.730
No.

07:14.820 --> 07:15.700
So what are we going to do?

07:15.720 --> 07:18.060
I'm going to say dot and what format?

07:18.090 --> 07:19.560
Use a formatter here.

07:19.590 --> 07:25.290
So it's very important because as you can see, format or type is going to be daytime format or object.

07:25.710 --> 07:31.400
So I'm going to start typing date type, format, object and then I'm going to invoke the Aave pattern.

07:31.410 --> 07:41.370
This of patterns allow us to show dates in a different format so it can say, for instance, July 18th

07:41.910 --> 07:46.800
or Wednesday, July 23.

07:46.890 --> 07:52.010
Can even have years of 1999, something like this.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.830
So that's what we are trying to pass here to say.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.610
OK, what is the pattern that we want to pass now?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.050
Now there are a lot of patterns, right for date time format.

08:01.470 --> 08:06.990
You can say daytime formatter patterns on Google, you can find a lot of them and they will look like

08:06.990 --> 08:08.820
something like this e

08:11.130 --> 08:15.990
comma space D and then m m m like this.

08:16.860 --> 08:17.100
OK.

08:18.600 --> 08:27.210
So this will give us a nice format of the day of the week and then the date and the month or so, and

08:27.210 --> 08:30.090
then we still inside of our text there.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.150
I can go back and put in a style

08:36.720 --> 08:44.550
material scene, typography and I a caption make it smaller.

08:45.690 --> 08:45.990
Right.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.230
So if you go here and let's go ahead and refresh, we should see something different, hopefully.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.970
Of course, you won't see anything different because we're not calling different note of row.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.100
What a waste of time.

08:59.370 --> 08:59.820
OK.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.700
So here I'm going to hold note row.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.560
Sorry, I'm just smiling here.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.570
And we're past our note and therefore on click.

09:08.580 --> 09:13.380
For now, I am just not going to do anything because we don't want to deal with it until later.

09:13.390 --> 09:15.330
So let's go ahead and refresh one more time.

09:15.660 --> 09:24.990
Hopefully, we should see something pleasing to the eye and one that very nice can see.

09:24.990 --> 09:29.610
It looks really, really nice because we changed that.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.230
Make this perhaps bigger.

09:31.650 --> 09:36.480
You can look at it now because we changed the clip.

09:37.020 --> 09:40.820
We say the bottom start and top end, right?

09:41.130 --> 09:44.370
These we added that clip and looks really nice.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.280
But most importantly, look at the data that we have now.

09:47.280 --> 09:51.470
We have the actual title of our entry.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.200
We have the description, the actual entry and the date.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.160
It's it's Thursday, the 28th of October.

10:00.030 --> 10:00.300
All right.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.260
So things are looking good.

10:01.560 --> 10:10.380
In fact, if I go ahead and run now this app on my emulator or in your case, when your phone is my

10:10.380 --> 10:13.950
case actually is on the phone, you can see that we have these nice entries.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.990
All of these are dummy data, but nonetheless we have this infrastructure set up for us.

10:20.140 --> 10:28.330
OK, so what's left to do now is to be able to add something like this and then save it when we save

10:28.330 --> 10:31.000
it, we want to be able to add to this list.

10:31.930 --> 10:32.200
OK.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.720
That's what we're going to be looking at next.

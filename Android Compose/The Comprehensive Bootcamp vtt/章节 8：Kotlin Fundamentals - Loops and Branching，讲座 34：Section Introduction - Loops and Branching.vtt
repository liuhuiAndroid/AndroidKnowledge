00:00.450 --> 00:01.680
So welcome to the section.

00:01.800 --> 00:06.240
It's very exciting, always to start a new section because we're going to learn something new, hopefully.

00:06.510 --> 00:12.480
OK, so when we talk about computing, we're talking about a lot of things, but basically we get everything

00:12.480 --> 00:12.900
out.

00:12.930 --> 00:18.030
When you talk about a programming file or a program in general, we're talking about ways in which we

00:18.030 --> 00:21.640
can take data, manipulate that data and get a result, right?

00:21.660 --> 00:26.850
But in this process of manipulating that data, there are a lot of decisions that have to be made,

00:26.850 --> 00:34.560
meaning that we have to create a tree like conditions that will respond to the data that we are passing

00:34.560 --> 00:34.900
through.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.150
What that means is as follow.

00:36.510 --> 00:41.280
So the idea of a program is that we create certain conditions, right?

00:41.400 --> 00:47.400
These conditions will allow us to then create some sort of a tree that will go and do certain things

00:47.430 --> 00:48.390
X, Y and Z.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.040
So the many is as follows.

00:50.040 --> 00:56.220
So if you have a condition that will spit out either true or false, so if condition X is true, then

00:56.220 --> 00:59.010
it will run code block B or do something.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.730
And if it's false, then write code Block eight.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.110
That's the condition that is tree like ramification that we're talking about here.

01:07.380 --> 01:12.750
But also, we can say else, if some other condition happens, then we're going to do Franko Block C.

01:12.930 --> 01:15.080
OK, so this is what we call branching.

01:15.090 --> 01:19.760
So we're creating these branches in our code, in our program that will do something.

01:19.770 --> 01:22.530
All of this is actually driven by data.

01:22.860 --> 01:26.850
So there's also a need to repeat certain tasks.

01:27.030 --> 01:33.620
For instance, we can say, while X is less than 10 or 100, we want to repeat a certain task.

01:33.630 --> 01:39.690
That's what we call looping when we take these two topics of branching and loops in any programming

01:39.690 --> 01:40.370
language, really.

01:40.440 --> 01:46.920
This is what makes a program a program, because now it on its own can make those decisions can repeat

01:46.920 --> 01:51.870
certain tasks that it needs to repeat until a certain condition is met and then gets out of that loop

01:52.110 --> 01:58.590
and then goes back to the branching and goes back and forth until the program is finished running all

01:58.590 --> 01:59.460
it needs to run.

01:59.640 --> 02:05.430
So this is what are we going to be focusing now to understand how the basics at least of loops and branching,

02:05.430 --> 02:10.020
you know, code so we can be a little bit more dangerous with what we can do with coupling?

02:10.170 --> 02:11.400
OK, let's go ahead and get started.

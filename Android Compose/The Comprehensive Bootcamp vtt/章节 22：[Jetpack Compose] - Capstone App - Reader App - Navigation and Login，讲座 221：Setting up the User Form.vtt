WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:07.680
So we've added our email input, and now here we're going to add yet another input or another text field.

00:08.160 --> 00:14.370
This is going to be called password input and we haven't created that.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.090
That's fine.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.890
And we're going to pass a few things.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.730
It's going to be pretty much the same what we had before, but there's some differences here.

00:20.730 --> 00:27.750
So I'm going to say modifier, for instance, and for modifying was a modifier that I'm going to pass

00:27.750 --> 00:28.500
the focus.

00:31.590 --> 00:34.500
Focus requests, so this means, like I said before.

00:35.010 --> 00:37.650
Let me give us some more space.

00:38.040 --> 00:43.320
It's going to get the focus of the moment that we are done with IMO input right on keyboard actions.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.320
The focus will go directly to our password input.

00:46.890 --> 00:49.290
OK, so this is how we pass it along.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.990
So notice this password request focus request.

00:52.350 --> 01:00.540
We're created here as a default request, but then we are then passing it along to request to request

01:00.540 --> 01:01.110
that focus.

01:01.380 --> 01:07.170
And then we need to pass that object along here to say that, OK, when this email input they hit on

01:07.170 --> 01:09.720
action, keyboard enter or whatever they do next.

01:10.140 --> 01:14.220
They are going to see the focus going to our password input.

01:15.030 --> 01:20.970
Next, we're going to pass the password state, I should call it, and it's going to save password,

01:21.960 --> 01:26.680
right and then label it.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.910
It's going to be password enabled.

01:32.310 --> 01:32.910
Be true.

01:32.910 --> 01:33.630
To begin with.

01:33.630 --> 01:34.650
We're going to change this.

01:35.040 --> 01:35.750
And then it goes.

01:35.790 --> 01:39.840
Password visibility is immutable state, of course.

01:40.650 --> 01:42.840
Capacity, password visibility.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.950
Going to check that out in a moment, you know, an action.

01:47.490 --> 01:55.660
The keyboard actions lambda there in that here is I'm going to put an if statement.

01:55.770 --> 01:59.730
I say if you need a valid password, it's not valid.

01:59.730 --> 02:05.640
That is when I just go ahead and return whatever the keyboard actions are set up and then I'm going

02:05.640 --> 02:13.950
to call the on done method here, which should then I'm going to pass the email value and I'm going

02:13.950 --> 02:20.400
to trim that value just to get rid of all the unnecessary spaces and so forth and pass the password.

02:20.670 --> 02:23.250
Also, the value and treating that as well.

02:23.730 --> 02:26.940
OK, now there's a lot of scripted now.

02:26.940 --> 02:30.940
There's a lot of things going on here, but we will decipher everything, right?

02:30.960 --> 02:34.290
Let's go ahead and create this password input there.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.480
Create a composable at the bottom here.

02:36.780 --> 02:37.380
And voila!

02:37.410 --> 02:42.240
If you do that, you can see, then we don't need to go through the trouble of having to pass all of

02:42.240 --> 02:44.750
these parameters ourselves.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.570
So this is really good.

02:45.570 --> 02:53.880
In fact, it can also out option enter and put on a separate lines like this and beautiful saves us

02:53.880 --> 02:54.420
a lot of work.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.300
There's one more detail to pass here, which is Almy.

02:57.300 --> 03:05.040
Action was I am e action that done so I'm going to show just done, as did button on keyboard.

03:05.790 --> 03:11.130
So inside here is where we're going to actually do the same thing we did before them and say, outline

03:11.490 --> 03:13.820
TextView and what a pass.

03:13.830 --> 03:20.190
Of course, our password state and on value change here accepts a lambda, thankfully.

03:20.400 --> 03:28.860
And what I'm going to do is, let's say, password state that a value gonna give it and we're going

03:28.860 --> 03:30.720
to add the it.

03:32.530 --> 03:33.850
Like this looks like.

03:34.090 --> 03:34.520
Right?

03:34.540 --> 03:38.350
So this has to be the value is going to get the value like this.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.950
Then we can get to the I.T. like the actual string that will be coming from our text field.

03:46.600 --> 03:51.370
OK, so we're going to do the same thing really a lot of repetition, but I guess this is how we learn.

03:52.300 --> 04:00.400
And let's see here I'm going to pass the label and I'm going to pass text label I.D..

04:02.870 --> 04:06.170
Single line, single line, the bullion.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.450
I'm going to say true, I want this to be a single line Muscat textile here.

04:12.720 --> 04:21.440
Uh, give it a font size of about 18 HP color again.

04:21.530 --> 04:23.360
Good material theme.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.050
Callers on background.

04:32.490 --> 04:36.720
Pass on my fire first to modify that we have upstairs.

04:37.270 --> 04:42.280
I'm going to pass the padding bottom again, 10 deep.

04:44.340 --> 04:56.310
Start 10 DP and worst 10 DP as such, all right, and then fill Max with just want to get the whole

04:56.310 --> 05:01.170
width and let's say, enabled, I want to pass enabled.

05:03.100 --> 05:08.440
This guy, their keyboard options, keyboard tie.

05:10.360 --> 05:18.100
Keyboard type, password and army action and pass that one along.

05:18.460 --> 05:23.890
And the great thing about these outlying text field, there are a lot of arguments we can pass if you

05:23.890 --> 05:26.320
have over all of this stuff, right?

05:26.770 --> 05:29.660
We've passed, most of them line a single line.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.250
Actually, we passed only this single line keyboard types options.

05:33.550 --> 05:36.820
Now there is this visual transformation that we can pass.

05:36.970 --> 05:43.920
This will allow us to transform visually what users can see or cannot see within this outline text field.

05:43.930 --> 05:46.270
So we're going to use that, especially for our password.

05:46.900 --> 05:55.130
So right after this guy there, I'm going to just put a comma and then I'm going to say visual transformation.

05:55.180 --> 06:04.390
So it needs a visual transformation type one passive visual trends for nation variable like this?

06:04.690 --> 06:06.460
Let's go ahead and create that at the top here.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.620
Two separate things a little bit.

06:09.850 --> 06:11.050
So at the top of our

06:14.020 --> 06:18.370
function, let's say vowel visual transformation.

06:19.180 --> 06:28.390
I'm going to say if password visibility right, that value is true to say that value like that and when

06:28.390 --> 06:33.240
it's just go ahead and call visual transformation, that none, right?

06:33.280 --> 06:35.590
Because in this case, everything is good.

06:36.850 --> 06:43.900
Else I'm going to say password visual transformation like this, if you have over what is this?

06:44.230 --> 06:50.230
Well, says the visual filter that can be used for password input field and we can continue, let's

06:50.230 --> 06:52.900
say I want to add a trailing icon.

06:53.010 --> 06:57.320
And this is, of course, a trailing lambda.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.150
No pun intended.

06:58.330 --> 07:05.020
So in this case, here we're going to pass another composable called password visibility, which we

07:05.020 --> 07:06.460
haven't created yet.

07:06.610 --> 07:08.470
And then I'm going to pass the password.

07:09.040 --> 07:13.180
Visibility like such, it's going to be equal to password visibility.

07:13.180 --> 07:17.980
So I'm just setting it up with this Boolean password or visibility, or we're going to be passing their

07:18.070 --> 07:19.180
password visibility.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.590
What is I want to happen.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.330
What's happening with this?

07:23.170 --> 07:30.100
Well, what we want to do here inside is as follow us, we're going to create a visible variable here.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.790
I'm going to say a password visibility just to get that, that value.

07:34.090 --> 07:40.060
OK, and then I'm going to add in icon buttons when I say icon like this button?

07:43.010 --> 07:50.720
And when that is clicked in this case and when I say password visibility, this value mutable state,

07:50.720 --> 07:59.180
that value, I'm going to say is not set that to not visible, so not visible like this.

07:59.570 --> 08:05.930
And instead of a lambda here, I'm just going to pass passing icons that default, that close.

08:06.320 --> 08:12.110
So for our password input, also, I have this on action that it's not being used or set up.

08:12.110 --> 08:18.830
So let's go ahead and actually say keyboard default action just like we did before with all the other

08:18.830 --> 08:19.100
ones.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.560
All right, now we're going to have an issue here because if you look at it where we call it password

08:24.560 --> 08:26.930
input, we have this down on done so.

08:27.050 --> 08:32.600
This is just like a callback function that it will take in the email and the password.

08:32.640 --> 08:32.900
Right?

08:33.290 --> 08:38.420
So when they click done or next in the keyboard, we want to give it all that information.

08:38.930 --> 08:44.090
So that means then in our user form here, there are a few parameters we are going to pass because we

08:44.090 --> 08:47.270
want to obviously process this information.

08:47.570 --> 08:53.570
The first parameter I'm going to pass, it's I'm going to call this loading and it's going to be a Boolean

08:54.140 --> 08:55.700
and it's going to be false.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.550
In the beginning, we'll see that in the second and then I'm going to pass.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.220
Another one call is create a count.

09:02.630 --> 09:08.180
It's going to be a Boolean to because we're going to reuse this same form in different cases, some

09:08.360 --> 09:10.370
boolean and make it false.

09:10.850 --> 09:11.210
OK.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.230
As a default.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.150
And then we're going to pass it on.

09:14.150 --> 09:14.690
Done.

09:16.650 --> 09:23.580
Here, method and this is going to create, well, passing as two strings, right, the email and the

09:23.580 --> 09:27.600
password like that, and then we can have us return a unit.

09:27.690 --> 09:32.670
So this is the done, the method that we're going to be using, as you see here.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.500
For now, let's just go ahead and say empty like that.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.610
So preview can work.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.610
So this one down here is where it's going to be called right here.

09:42.630 --> 09:49.980
We passed the email because it says we need to pass two strings passwords just so that we still have

09:49.980 --> 09:50.850
this preview to work.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.650
Looks like he needs everything.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.400
OK, there we go.

09:56.510 --> 09:57.710
All right, we'll change that, of course.

09:57.710 --> 10:02.150
We just want to make sure that our previous work, so it must pass, we must pass something there,

10:02.780 --> 10:03.050
right?

10:03.920 --> 10:06.680
So this is the only one that will be called.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.270
So you see here we have enabled.

10:08.270 --> 10:11.750
So our enabled here we set it to true, we need to do something about it.

10:12.140 --> 10:17.270
But if you look at the top here, we see that we have this floating variable that we passed or parameter

10:17.270 --> 10:18.140
in this case, right?

10:18.620 --> 10:19.550
So what is this for?

10:19.580 --> 10:24.200
Well, this is going to be for our log in button or create account button, as you will see later.

10:24.560 --> 10:31.840
The idea is we want later to check to see if we want to make this button enabled or disabled, right,

10:31.940 --> 10:37.580
depending on the information that we're putting in our email and password fields like the input itself.

10:38.120 --> 10:45.620
So this is important because then we can check whether the loading is true and if that's true and the

10:45.620 --> 10:47.870
inputs are valid, then what are we going to do?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.420
We can then change the state of this button.

10:51.950 --> 10:58.850
OK, so we are going to pass that loading along here, I'm going to toggle it and we say the opposite

10:58.850 --> 11:01.220
of what's happening to say, loading a section.

11:01.940 --> 11:06.890
And that happens also with our password input.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.340
This is for our password input, let's say.

11:10.160 --> 11:15.140
Also for our input email input that is so loading like this?

11:16.660 --> 11:18.490
We'll see in a second how all of that works.

11:18.820 --> 11:21.550
Let's go and see, I think everything is set up.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.510
Let's go ahead and run.

11:22.660 --> 11:25.630
And hopefully we can see something in our screen.

11:25.870 --> 11:32.620
I believe a reader, of course, nothing is showing there, I think is because I haven't called the

11:32.620 --> 11:34.600
user form where.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.600
Yes, you guessed it user.

11:38.350 --> 11:41.800
And I need to pass a few arguments here for loading.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.460
Let's say it's false.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.230
Right?

11:44.740 --> 11:46.570
And then is create account.

11:46.570 --> 11:51.070
In this case, I'm also going to say false.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.320
So we see a few things.

11:53.590 --> 11:55.960
And of course, we have a trailing lambda here.

11:56.260 --> 12:02.040
This is where we're going to have our email, access, our email and password, right?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.870
And for now, I'm going to just log D.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.470
I say email form.

12:07.570 --> 12:13.210
And of course, I'm going to have an issue here because of course, this user form is using that experimental

12:13.210 --> 12:15.760
compose UI, and we have to add that.

12:15.790 --> 12:23.380
So I'm going to go ahead and add that to our reader log in screen so we can see things working this

12:24.220 --> 12:24.970
change like that.

12:25.060 --> 12:28.660
OK, so now let's see if this works right again.

12:31.930 --> 12:34.260
And let's see, Angela.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.830
OK, we have this, too, if you click.

12:36.850 --> 12:37.420
There we go.

12:37.420 --> 12:43.450
We can put an email and you see because I can put at and so forth, code and password.

12:43.810 --> 12:46.960
And then of course, I can add my password and as you click.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.300
Now, of course, there are a few problems here.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.250
First of all, we have this space in between.

12:53.290 --> 12:54.340
That's not a problem.

12:54.340 --> 12:59.830
The world will change all of that in a second, but at least we could see that most of it is working.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.680
So next, we are going to, of course.

13:03.710 --> 13:07.610
Take care of the spacing issue and also add the buttons and so forth.

13:07.850 --> 13:12.860
This add on keyboard actions and going to pass on action like this.

13:12.950 --> 13:13.310
All right.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.170
So that everything is set up correctly.

13:15.410 --> 13:15.730
OK.

13:15.770 --> 13:16.530
Should be all good.

13:17.270 --> 13:20.060
Let's remove all of this, of course.

13:21.880 --> 13:30.490
And put it somewhere else in this case, let's go back to our components just to have a place where

13:30.490 --> 13:34.750
we can have all of these little components live.

13:35.080 --> 13:41.740
And of course, back here, we have to import all of this and all this good, and I promise we will

13:41.740 --> 13:42.930
finish this and move on.

13:42.940 --> 13:46.570
But it's an important concept that I'm trying to show you here.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.190
All right, I'll see you next.

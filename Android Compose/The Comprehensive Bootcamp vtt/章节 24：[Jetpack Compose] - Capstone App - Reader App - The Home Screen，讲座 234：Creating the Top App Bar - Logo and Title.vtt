WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:05.430
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to put together the scaffolding of the structure

00:05.430 --> 00:11.070
of this application, so you can see at the bottom here we do have this nice floating action button.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.870
That's what we're going to be putting together.

00:12.870 --> 00:17.490
So we're going to use a scaffold so we can add at the top bar and so forth.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.350
OK, let's get started.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.590
So opening our reader home screen.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.290
So at this point, we just have this text.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.630
I am home, which is not flattering.

00:27.780 --> 00:32.910
So we're going to get rid of this altogether because we are going to make this even better and make

00:32.910 --> 00:37.380
this beautiful and get to what we want and show you exactly what we need to do.

00:37.830 --> 00:38.150
All right.

00:38.160 --> 00:43.920
So the first thing, of course, I'm going to add is scaffolding here or scaffold.

00:47.640 --> 00:53.730
And if you have a over a can see that we can pass through arguments here for our scaffold modifier,

00:53.730 --> 00:57.360
of course, have top bar, bottom bar, snack bar host.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.560
And of course, we will be able to add content to our scaffold.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.050
That's a really good structure, and I love it.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.870
So first, I'm going to add a top bar.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.680
It's going to be, of course, a lambda can there.

01:11.580 --> 01:20.370
And then right after that, I'm going to add the floating action button, which is also going to be

01:20.760 --> 01:24.030
who can add a trailing lambda as well.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.910
And then here is where we're going to have our content.

01:27.540 --> 01:31.650
Now we are able to add this floating action button there.

01:31.950 --> 01:40.200
So here I'm going to have a fab content composable and it's going to be a lambda actually go ahead and

01:40.200 --> 01:42.150
create this composable.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.360
And while I can see we're passing a function about this dysfunction here, I'm going to call this,

01:48.600 --> 01:56.250
this is going to take care of ONTAP such and we're going to pass a string when that happens so that

01:56.250 --> 01:58.170
we can retrieve whatever we need to retrieve.

01:58.200 --> 01:58.800
We'll see that.

01:59.370 --> 01:59.750
All right.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.750
So our fab here, I'm going to say floating action button.

02:03.810 --> 02:04.510
There it is.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.900
And there is the click.

02:07.020 --> 02:11.670
And if you have a over, of course, like any composable, you can see, we're going to pass a lot of

02:11.670 --> 02:14.780
arguments, my fire action shape and so forth, right?

02:15.330 --> 02:22.440
So what we want to do is we want to have a structure such as this so we can have, of course, this

02:22.440 --> 02:24.510
circle with the plus icon.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.330
So, Guy, put a sheep on, say, rounded corners, shave.

02:32.790 --> 02:36.300
And in the past, about 50, someone this really round.

02:39.020 --> 02:39.710
We're glad.

02:41.450 --> 02:44.660
And then I want to pass background color.

02:45.470 --> 02:47.810
And for now, let's say material theme.

02:48.590 --> 02:53.030
And we're going to pass colors, let's say background color like this.

02:53.750 --> 03:01.760
And then inside, I'm going to add an icon and this icon and let's say icons, dot, default dot and

03:02.360 --> 03:05.390
icon or plus sign there and contents.

03:06.050 --> 03:11.930
I'm just going and for the content description here, for visually impaired people, we can say something

03:12.350 --> 03:16.940
like add a book, or perhaps yes, add a book.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.510
And also it can pass a tint color here.

03:21.030 --> 03:29.270
See material theme, see colors that on on secondary like this.

03:29.630 --> 03:35.720
So that means then where we call this, which is right here, we do have our lambda on tap, which means

03:35.720 --> 03:36.560
we can use that.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.480
And this is where we're going to pass something, right?

03:39.500 --> 03:43.970
In this case, the one click is going to pass the string if we need to and go from there.

03:44.570 --> 03:47.600
OK, now we need to make sure that is on tap is called somewhere.

03:47.600 --> 03:53.420
So it's called is our own tap and all we need really at this point, just pass an empty string where

03:53.420 --> 03:55.160
there's really nothing that we want to pass there.

03:57.340 --> 04:04.870
In fact, I can just remove this altogether, say that I don't want to pass anything, just call on

04:04.870 --> 04:05.200
tap.

04:06.130 --> 04:09.760
And as for our content here, let's go ahead and put a service.

04:11.530 --> 04:21.780
I'm going to add a modifier modifier such and I want to fill max size and here we'll add our home content.

04:23.580 --> 04:23.800
All right.

04:24.730 --> 04:28.750
Let's go ahead and give you a run real quick so we hopefully can see something.

04:30.790 --> 04:36.130
And there you have it, just like that, I can see you have that nice button floating action button

04:36.130 --> 04:36.970
at the bottom there.

04:37.120 --> 04:41.350
Now this doesn't look that great because we have, of course, we don't have a nice color there because

04:41.350 --> 04:45.940
I just added the material thing, which is fine, but let's change that real quick manually.

04:45.970 --> 04:54.190
So some of that change of background color here to a hex color that we have so color and then say zero

04:54.190 --> 05:00.820
x half f two CBD f like this and you can see it's going to be this nice color there.

05:00.830 --> 05:04.870
So let's go ahead and run again just to see a nice.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.580
OK, so it looks really nice.

05:07.150 --> 05:11.860
It's got we can go ahead and say something again, like colors.

05:15.540 --> 05:22.830
Don White Cat, and you can see now looks pretty much like, what do we have here?

05:23.170 --> 05:27.140
OK, next, let's go ahead and see if we can at the top what we have here to our top bar.

05:27.150 --> 05:32.790
So it's easy to do that because remember, we have our scaffold and we have our top bar.

05:33.090 --> 05:39.090
So here I can say because I'm going to be using, we're going to be using this top bar in different

05:39.090 --> 05:40.290
places, right?

05:40.680 --> 05:44.410
And we want to make sure that it is customizable depending on the screen.

05:44.430 --> 05:45.930
There are a few things that we're going to change.

05:46.230 --> 05:51.900
So I'm going to create, of course, a separate composable top bar.

05:52.380 --> 06:04.920
So here I'm going to just say and say at composable a function called this reader app bar, and it would

06:04.920 --> 06:07.080
have has a few parameters.

06:09.030 --> 06:14.220
The first one being the title that we're going to pass, right, going to be a string.

06:14.820 --> 06:20.460
And then I'm going to pass a Boolean called show profile because it's like I said, in some places,

06:20.460 --> 06:22.470
I won't need to show a profile.

06:22.830 --> 06:23.370
We'll see.

06:23.910 --> 06:24.750
Going to be a Boolean.

06:25.110 --> 06:26.430
At first, it's going to be.

06:27.990 --> 06:34.080
True, as a default value, and of course, I want to pass out enough controller if need be.

06:34.610 --> 06:34.880
Right?

06:35.850 --> 06:39.450
So inside here, I'm just going to create a top bar.

06:39.690 --> 06:45.920
We do get a top bar composable that comes with compose for a title.

06:45.930 --> 06:50.160
It's going to be a canvas, a lambda there, and it's going to be.

06:50.340 --> 06:57.150
I'm going to add a row because I want to create this structure here and then we can pass actions.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.080
Oops.

06:58.410 --> 07:03.330
Going to be right after this one, let's say actions as such.

07:04.170 --> 07:08.760
OK, so looks like I don't need to pass any lambda like this, OK?

07:09.390 --> 07:14.400
And of course, inside, if you have over a top party, you will see that we can pass elevation, the

07:14.400 --> 07:15.720
background colors and so forth.

07:16.140 --> 07:21.930
Let's pass the background color, so I'm going to make this transparent.

07:22.890 --> 07:30.000
Such an elevation is going to be zero dpi because I don't want to see any elevation whatsoever, and

07:30.000 --> 07:32.020
I like to put things this way first.

07:32.020 --> 07:37.500
That way you can see what are you working with because you will see or as you've noticed in compose,

07:37.980 --> 07:44.250
you are piling up all of the or passing arguments into our composable.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.370
And sometimes can look really funky, very strange.

07:47.370 --> 07:54.690
So putting the structure like this first, all of our arguments as they are like this right now, it

07:54.690 --> 07:57.600
just helps you to see exactly what to fill in.

07:57.870 --> 08:02.730
OK, so now for a title, what I want to do is I want to have this structure here.

08:02.740 --> 08:06.570
I'm going to have an icon and then something like this and then like that.

08:06.630 --> 08:06.900
OK.

08:07.710 --> 08:13.080
So in this case here, I'm just going to go ahead and say for a title, I'm going to put a row first.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.890
So this row I'm going to make it vertical.

08:16.950 --> 08:23.840
It's got you import or row, and I'm going to check if show profile, right?

08:25.080 --> 08:35.250
It's true, then I'm going to add an image or image painter when I use or a painter resource pass an

08:35.250 --> 08:36.270
image that I may have.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.100
So I'm going to say it.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.090
Or are that?

08:40.380 --> 08:42.660
And it looks like our art is not.

08:43.140 --> 08:47.880
So let's say ah, and sometimes takes time to show which are we looking for?

08:48.210 --> 08:50.880
We want this are for resources, for our apps.

08:50.890 --> 08:55.110
Look for the one that has your package name like this.

08:55.210 --> 08:55.470
OK?

08:56.070 --> 09:02.460
Enter can see that drabble such and I want to go and get the I see.

09:05.590 --> 09:10.360
Launcher now, you may not have this, let's go finalize, this will quick.

09:10.510 --> 09:16.240
This is going to be, say, just icon, but at this point actually what it can do.

09:16.240 --> 09:20.470
Instead of adding this icy launcher, I can just add an icon.

09:20.500 --> 09:25.570
All I want really is to have an icon that represent this app so you can create your own icon content

09:25.570 --> 09:28.390
online and find an icon for your app.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.970
I just have one here, and so it's OK.

09:30.970 --> 09:35.080
We don't have to add exactly like that, so I'm going to get rid of this.

09:35.530 --> 09:43.810
So now I'm just going to be the icon and pass our icons default and I want.

09:47.120 --> 09:52.290
Person or a book, do I have a book a book right now?

09:52.310 --> 09:53.420
Let's get this.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.320
I had a favorite.

09:54.830 --> 09:55.820
That's totally fine.

09:55.910 --> 09:56.960
So it doesn't really matter.

09:57.470 --> 10:04.130
And then for the content description here, I'm just going to say logo icon.

10:04.790 --> 10:05.180
All right.

10:05.390 --> 10:08.090
And of course, we can pass modifier here,

10:11.750 --> 10:15.380
and I'm going to clip.

10:17.780 --> 10:22.790
This icon with a rounded corners shape.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.770
I just give 12 dpi all around.

10:28.160 --> 10:37.070
And let's go ahead and scale it down to at least 0.6 or about 60 percent scaling down.

10:37.820 --> 10:40.310
So it's out of if statement here I'm going to put a text.

10:40.610 --> 10:49.610
This text will take the title that we're passing right and we can set it up better.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.980
Give it some adjustments here.

10:52.980 --> 10:53.900
OK, I say color.

10:55.350 --> 11:08.350
And he is a scholar that read not copy and pass an alpha here and 0.7 float just to get that nice right

11:08.350 --> 11:08.680
there.

11:09.490 --> 11:15.370
Let's also give a style, Texas style font weight.

11:15.580 --> 11:20.260
I want this to be a bold and size about $20.

11:20.680 --> 11:29.080
OK, let's go ahead and import that real quick and see if we can call that first of all, inside of

11:29.080 --> 11:29.510
here.

11:29.540 --> 11:36.760
Reader App Bar This title is going to be a dot reader.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.930
Pass our knife controller like this.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.480
Let's go ahead and run this just to see, OK.

11:46.670 --> 11:47.420
It looks really good.

11:47.780 --> 11:48.860
Very small there.

11:48.890 --> 11:52.910
Maybe I can change the scale here.

11:53.090 --> 11:55.430
Make a little bit bigger by the second one.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.320
Okay, let's start again.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.480
Scale up, actually.

12:00.870 --> 12:01.170
OK.

12:02.070 --> 12:02.700
Let's see.

12:05.530 --> 12:06.470
All right, that's fine.

12:06.490 --> 12:09.490
Doesn't really matter because you are going to add your own anyway.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.620
So are we making progress here?

12:11.740 --> 12:13.960
We are creating this structure here at the top.

12:14.200 --> 12:19.380
As you see, we now have the icon, which is different in this, but that's fine.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.250
And then we have a reader then.

12:21.430 --> 12:25.090
Next, we're going to add this sign out button there.

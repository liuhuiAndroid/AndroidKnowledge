WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:04.480
Let's go ahead and get started by creating a new project, so have Android Studio open.

00:04.530 --> 00:10.380
I say file new project such and it's going to be an empty compose activity.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.240
Say next.

00:11.250 --> 00:17.460
And in this case here, I'm actually going to go to a folder that I've already created where this will

00:17.460 --> 00:20.370
live and you can just pick whatever you want.

00:20.370 --> 00:25.320
But for me, I'm going to go to a special place called Jet Base Card like that.

00:25.710 --> 00:26.460
There you go.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.340
And I say open when I say finish going to start.

00:29.730 --> 00:35.050
So the Gradle is building everything in the background so we can create a new project.

00:35.070 --> 00:40.340
Now, the reason why you see all of this is because this is actually connected to GitHub repo.

00:40.350 --> 00:41.820
So that's why we have all this.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.140
They rig me and so forth.

00:43.230 --> 00:44.670
OK, so you won't see any of this.

00:44.750 --> 00:45.780
So that's totally fine.

00:46.050 --> 00:49.740
After a few moments, should be able to see a project like this.

00:50.250 --> 00:54.930
There's a lot of code that comes with these preconfigured project, as you see here.

00:55.230 --> 00:59.250
So there's a few things that may be shaky at this moment because we've never seen it.

00:59.670 --> 01:04.170
But I also want to remind you that this small app we're going to be building, it's just going to be

01:04.170 --> 01:06.000
something to show off per se.

01:06.030 --> 01:09.270
What can be done with Android Compose, Jetpack Compose?

01:09.270 --> 01:15.150
OK, so at this point, I'm just assuming that you knew and we just want to get something to go right

01:15.150 --> 01:15.570
away.

01:15.630 --> 01:20.610
OK, so if you don't understand a few things here, in fact, it is expected that you want to understand

01:20.610 --> 01:22.720
everything that is OK.

01:22.740 --> 01:27.070
Again, I repeat that Estoril, OK, just go along with the ride.

01:27.090 --> 01:31.950
I'm just going to show you how to build a business card to show off, as I said, what can be done with

01:31.950 --> 01:32.410
compose?

01:32.460 --> 01:38.400
So don't worry, if you don't understand everything, we will have plenty of time to actually dig into

01:38.640 --> 01:41.070
this whole Android jetpack composting.

01:41.340 --> 01:41.670
OK.

01:41.910 --> 01:42.210
All right.

01:42.410 --> 01:42.490
Good.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.460
OK, so what are we going to be building?

01:44.610 --> 01:48.240
As I mentioned earlier, this is what we're going to be putting together.

01:48.570 --> 01:54.850
So I would say it's a business card probably should call it more of an EE business card, right?

01:54.870 --> 01:58.860
So it kind of shows you a few things that we're going to put together.

01:58.860 --> 01:59.490
So it's going to be.

01:59.940 --> 02:06.390
First of all, we're going to have some sort of a nice layout at the back ground and then we're going

02:06.390 --> 02:07.230
to have an image.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.310
Of course, we're going to have the name and then the profession.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.540
And then, of course, the Twitter handle and then button.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.760
So this button portfolio was once clicked.

02:17.010 --> 02:23.400
We're going to show off some sort of a list containing projects then on this programmer has worked on,

02:23.610 --> 02:23.880
right?

02:23.910 --> 02:24.780
So very simplistic.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.660
But nevertheless, it's going to hopefully get you going.

02:28.050 --> 02:29.550
OK, let's go ahead and get started.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.740
OK, so one thing we need to look at real quick here is what is going on.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.800
So first of all, we have this main activity class, which in this case inherits from component activity

02:41.130 --> 02:43.570
and we have the override on create.

02:43.590 --> 02:47.190
So this is where essentially the entry point of an Android application.

02:47.400 --> 02:47.700
OK.

02:47.820 --> 02:52.840
So the thing you notice also here is that we have this set content method, if you will.

02:52.860 --> 02:53.940
This is actually lambda.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.710
But don't worry, we never talked about Lambda.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.270
We haven't talked about lambda before.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.690
So this is this is fine.

02:58.710 --> 03:04.950
So just think of a block of code where we can actually pass another block of code, which we can also

03:04.950 --> 03:06.830
pass on a block of code, as you can see.

03:06.840 --> 03:07.170
OK?

03:07.560 --> 03:12.510
So we to set content, as the name implies, this is we are going to set any kind of the view of the

03:12.510 --> 03:16.130
activity and then we pass here this based card theme.

03:16.140 --> 03:17.320
So this is all created.

03:17.330 --> 03:21.370
Remember, this is not something that we have written ourselves.

03:21.390 --> 03:26.040
This comes when we use the wizard to create a compose application.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.320
So all of this is given so small pieces here.

03:28.470 --> 03:32.820
And then we have this surface thing looks like a class looks like method.

03:32.970 --> 03:36.450
We don't know what this is yet, but what we know is the surface.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.730
What he does is we are able to pass in a color.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.050
So it goes to material.

03:40.050 --> 03:43.440
Themes go, it gets colors and then get the background color, OK?

03:43.950 --> 03:48.630
And then of course, there is a block of code that we can pass inside of the surface.

03:48.750 --> 03:52.570
So if you think about this, this surface is going to be some sort of a canvas.

03:52.590 --> 03:53.440
It makes sense, right?

03:53.460 --> 03:56.070
So instead of like canvas, we're saying we're going to pass something else.

03:56.070 --> 04:01.140
In this case, it's going to be greeting, which if you click and highlighted, you can see that it

04:01.140 --> 04:05.640
is indeed here a function which has this at composable and we get into that.

04:05.670 --> 04:06.570
So what are we saying here?

04:06.570 --> 04:13.080
Is that this greeting we pass in a string as you see there's a string and then it's going to do something

04:13.260 --> 04:13.600
right?

04:13.620 --> 04:14.880
We're going to have this text.

04:15.090 --> 04:19.920
This text is going to have a text, obviously, and we're going to pass this name that's being passed

04:20.250 --> 04:21.690
through our greeting function.

04:22.230 --> 04:25.380
So that's why you say when you pass greeting, we pass Android.

04:25.380 --> 04:27.270
We see he says, Hello, Android.

04:27.450 --> 04:30.000
So what do we have to do right here now if you don't see this?

04:30.240 --> 04:34.410
That probably means you have this toggle the code only toggle.

04:34.410 --> 04:40.140
So I'll have to do is just go to split mode to be able to preview what we have here.

04:40.230 --> 04:43.590
In fact, you can also move to the right to make it smaller or larger.

04:43.710 --> 04:49.050
What's actually happening here is that if you scroll back down here, you'll see that we have another

04:49.050 --> 04:51.370
function called default preview again.

04:51.390 --> 04:56.220
All of these was created by our Wizard of Android Studio, and they're all for that so that we have

04:56.280 --> 04:59.640
some sort of a basic skeleton of a composer.

05:00.010 --> 05:05.050
So this default preview here is what's being called, in fact, if you make this a little bit bigger

05:05.050 --> 05:06.670
again, in fact you can't quite.

05:06.850 --> 05:10.660
But if you have over here, you will see it's calling default preview, right?

05:10.870 --> 05:14.230
So this is what it's being called to render here.

05:14.560 --> 05:14.920
All right.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.480
So that means then notice.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.960
We also call in the greeting and passing the android.

05:19.030 --> 05:21.640
So what's happening here, this greeting that's been passed?

05:21.730 --> 05:23.350
It's not what we are seeing here.

05:23.530 --> 05:29.180
This will be seen if we run this application right to push that onto an aim later.

05:29.380 --> 05:29.710
All right.

05:29.950 --> 05:36.370
So if I come here and say and I change this to something very issue, you'll notice I come up here now

05:36.370 --> 05:36.910
at the top.

05:36.940 --> 05:37.690
I'm going to refresh.

05:37.700 --> 05:44.020
In fact, I didn't have to because I went directly to this default preview and it changed there.

05:44.290 --> 05:49.930
So it's really nice because we're able then to change things or create what they call composable.

05:49.930 --> 05:55.080
So essentially, these functions that we can actually preview pieces of code to create a user interface,

05:55.090 --> 06:00.100
and we can see that preview here as opposed to having to run the application onto the emulator and so

06:00.100 --> 06:00.340
forth.

06:00.790 --> 06:01.060
All right.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.590
So just a few basics here.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.450
And remember, this is just the beginning.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.080
We will go through all these things that we have many hours coming up.

06:08.350 --> 06:09.010
What are we going through?

06:09.010 --> 06:10.360
All of this in more detail?

06:10.390 --> 06:15.310
Again, I just want to get you going real quick here, but I thought I will just give you a small preview

06:15.310 --> 06:16.170
of what's going on.

06:16.180 --> 06:17.440
No pun intended, of course.

06:17.620 --> 06:17.920
All right.

06:18.160 --> 06:18.470
Very good.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.720
So what are we going to do is I'm going to get rid of this.

06:23.170 --> 06:28.750
That, of course, is going to have a problem because the function that we just got rid of, it's been

06:28.750 --> 06:30.340
called in two places.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.450
So that's not a problem.

06:31.750 --> 06:35.070
And I'm going to also get rid of that, OK, and get rid of that.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.130
And that would having a problem.

06:36.250 --> 06:42.330
And what I'm going to do, then I'm going to go ahead and say at start typing composable like that.

06:42.340 --> 06:48.010
So this is needed to tell the compiler that this is a composable function, which means it's part of

06:48.010 --> 06:54.790
the compose library, which allows us to create functions that we then are able to pass on and see the

06:54.790 --> 06:58.000
default here, but also pass on onto our emulator.

06:58.090 --> 07:04.120
All right, so just follow along when you say fun to say function and when it called is create like

07:04.120 --> 07:07.780
this, create this card like that.

07:08.180 --> 07:12.460
OK, so this is going to be our composable function that we can call anywhere we want.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.760
But most importantly, we're going to call inside here or default view default preview should say this

07:17.770 --> 07:21.070
when I say, create this card like that.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.150
And of course, I'm just going to call instead of this surface here.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.420
Let me make this a little smaller.

07:25.420 --> 07:27.380
So perhaps we have more space here.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.800
This is card in error.

07:29.980 --> 07:30.250
All right.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.300
So now if I refresh, you'll see that we're not going to have much.

07:34.300 --> 07:38.500
In fact, we won't see anything which is a good thing because we haven't done anything inside of our

07:38.650 --> 07:40.750
composable create base card.

07:41.110 --> 07:46.180
Now, this may take a little while and we can always continue working on what we were doing here until

07:46.660 --> 07:48.880
this Runescape because we're refreshing everything.

07:49.210 --> 07:52.780
It's rendering, previewing and it may take a little bit of time.

07:52.780 --> 07:54.100
So just be a little patient.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.600
OK, and there we go.

07:55.750 --> 08:01.180
As you see, we see nothing really is just a little blip of a white dot there.

08:01.510 --> 08:03.190
We haven't done anything instead of a great base.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.240
So let's do something.

08:04.390 --> 08:05.770
I'm going to say Tex, right?

08:05.770 --> 08:06.790
We want to show text.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.530
If you start typing text again.

08:08.530 --> 08:12.010
See, now we have this possibility of things that we can pass in, right?

08:12.130 --> 08:18.970
Again, these are functions that come with compose library, so they are available for us to use.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.490
So if I hit enter it, notice that I can pass text.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.930
This is the same thing we had before.

08:23.260 --> 08:23.650
OK.

08:23.830 --> 08:29.200
But I'm just going to show you how all of this is created, so I'm going to say this card as such and

08:29.200 --> 08:30.340
go ahead and refresh again.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.290
We should now see something, hopefully.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.010
Aha.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.530
And there we go now we can see, says base card.

08:35.530 --> 08:41.740
So we created a text, right, which is actually another composable that will get to that and will pass

08:41.740 --> 08:43.750
in this card as the text will want to see.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.800
And you can see there it is.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.280
Based card.

08:45.400 --> 08:45.820
Very good.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.110
Now that's not what we want.

08:47.410 --> 08:53.170
What we want to do is to start putting together a user interface, which means this right, this whole

08:53.170 --> 08:54.220
enterprise, if you will.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.230
So we're going to start really small here.

08:56.410 --> 09:00.940
And what are we going to do is we're going to create this outer layer, as you see there.

09:01.330 --> 09:06.100
It's it's just like a card that looks really nice with nice corner borders there.

09:06.460 --> 09:06.760
All right.

09:07.150 --> 09:07.660
Let's do that.

09:07.670 --> 09:08.260
How do we do that?

09:08.680 --> 09:14.440
Well, what we can do is we can, of course, use what compose already gives to us.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.960
So the first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to put it inside of a surface.

09:17.230 --> 09:21.730
Yes, and its surface, so it's surface in this case is just a canvas whenever we want to create something

09:21.730 --> 09:23.200
that will be shown on the screen.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.340
We use a surface.

09:24.370 --> 09:29.770
There are other surfaces or other subtypes of surface, but we're going to start with the surface because

09:29.770 --> 09:32.080
this is going to be the main background, if you will.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.810
So I'm going to get enter and this may happen.

09:34.810 --> 09:38.200
So it's just importing the whole namespace, if you will.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.160
So or package.

09:39.190 --> 09:42.460
So here, as you can see, a lot of things are showing here.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.550
So we have Andrew X composed material that's not interesting to us.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.260
We can actually just get rid of that.

09:47.530 --> 09:50.320
Or I'll show you later how to automatically get rid of that.

09:50.350 --> 09:50.800
That's fine.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.960
So our surface here allows us to pass a few parameters so things that we can pass here to say, OK,

09:55.960 --> 09:58.870
how is this surface going to appear on this week?

09:59.020 --> 09:59.530
So what I'm going to.

09:59.590 --> 10:02.640
You hear I'm going to take with me, I'm going to say modifier, right?

10:03.010 --> 10:09.310
And he cannot say modifier, as the name implies, allows us to modify this entire surface so we can

10:09.310 --> 10:11.500
actually customize it, make it look good.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.160
All right.

10:12.370 --> 10:15.670
So there are a lot of properties we can pass with a modifier.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.580
So the first thing we want to do want to make sure that we make this whole surface, this whole canvas,

10:21.730 --> 10:23.230
to feel max width.

10:23.380 --> 10:29.350
So when I started typing feel like this and you can see I have options so it can go up and down until

10:29.350 --> 10:33.460
you find the right option right to the max width like that.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.030
OK.

10:34.180 --> 10:37.060
And then still is sort of this modifier, right?

10:37.060 --> 10:41.470
So I'm going to go ahead and say, Dad, we're going to access another property, which is the fill

10:41.770 --> 10:43.600
max height like that?

10:43.780 --> 10:44.890
OK, very good.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.550
And you can see now we have this block that blocks here.

10:48.550 --> 10:51.730
That means then what is it that we want to do inside of this surface?

10:51.940 --> 10:58.450
What are we saying right now here is that we have created a second something like this that will take

10:58.450 --> 11:00.190
up the entire space of the screen.

11:00.340 --> 11:03.520
Now we want to say, OK, what is that we're going to put inside of this thing?

11:03.670 --> 11:04.210
All right.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.460
Well, let's go ahead and refresh.

11:06.580 --> 11:10.120
First of all, the entire surface to see what's going to happen.

11:10.420 --> 11:10.850
And voila!

11:11.170 --> 11:15.520
And as you do that, you can see now we have the surface, it's a little bit bigger.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.080
So you can see there it is.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.970
Our surface is taking up all this space.

11:18.970 --> 11:24.880
In fact, make this a better site so you can toggle here to Zoom to fit the screen, or you can make

11:24.880 --> 11:27.730
it larger by zooming in or zooming out.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.270
OK, there we go.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.950
So now you see, we have a surface.

11:30.220 --> 11:30.730
This is good.

11:30.740 --> 11:35.260
So we have an android lining canvas where we can work in.

11:35.380 --> 11:40.330
So that's all we did inside of it to create be card surface there.

11:40.540 --> 11:44.110
So now inside here we can do the work we want, right?

11:44.560 --> 11:48.400
So inside of our surface now inside of this block here, right?

11:48.790 --> 11:54.460
This is where we can start putting things into our user interface, namely something like this.

11:54.820 --> 11:55.150
All right.

11:55.150 --> 11:56.530
We're going to continue in the next video.

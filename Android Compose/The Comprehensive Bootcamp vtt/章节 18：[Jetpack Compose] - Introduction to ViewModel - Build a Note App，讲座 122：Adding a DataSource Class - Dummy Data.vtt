WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:08.070
So we were able to see that our title and I note this card description states are working because we

00:08.070 --> 00:11.280
are able to add things to our fields.

00:11.610 --> 00:12.360
So this is really good.

00:12.810 --> 00:18.360
But what we want to do ultimately is to be able to save or at least when this is clicked, be able to

00:18.360 --> 00:21.220
say, Okay, let's go back to our note.

00:21.660 --> 00:27.630
I'm going to close down there because we don't need to look at this point at the user interface.

00:27.630 --> 00:28.890
We just want to look at the logic.

00:29.700 --> 00:35.670
So if you look at the next note button should say what should save, which says save.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.510
We have here the one click lambda.

00:39.630 --> 00:41.340
So what needs to happen here?

00:42.060 --> 00:52.440
Well, first of all, I'm going to validate and say if they want to check if title, that is not empty.

00:54.820 --> 00:55.360
And.

00:57.550 --> 01:01.090
Description also is not empty.

01:01.630 --> 01:10.030
Only then will I be able to say, let's save or add to the list.

01:10.570 --> 01:10.890
OK.

01:12.850 --> 01:15.130
But when that happened, I also want to do something.

01:15.130 --> 01:19.360
I want to clear our title and then just set that to empty.

01:19.390 --> 01:26.770
Like this, an empty string, as well as our description say and district, is how we clear the fields.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.920
Once we have clicked safe.

01:31.300 --> 01:31.550
OK.

01:31.870 --> 01:38.910
And remember, the reason why this title and and description are what they are, is because they are

01:38.920 --> 01:39.970
mutable state.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.580
We need those as we have talked about.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.750
Something to remember.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.590
But what is it?

01:44.590 --> 01:51.730
How do we then save or add this item into our list in this case?

01:52.260 --> 01:52.430
All right.

01:52.490 --> 01:56.440
So we are able to display at the bottom here something like this a later time.

01:57.160 --> 02:02.470
Here's a period we should go back to the top where we instantiate or created our note screen.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.420
Here, we need to pass a few parameters.

02:05.230 --> 02:11.500
Primarily, we want to be able to pass that responsibility to whoever is calling you, notes screen.

02:11.980 --> 02:19.510
So what I mean by that is we know that this note screen, because it's going to have also late our time

02:19.960 --> 02:22.330
on the list of all of these notes.

02:22.450 --> 02:22.750
Right.

02:23.230 --> 02:27.700
That means then here I'm going to have to pass notes like that.

02:28.050 --> 02:30.430
It's going to be a list of notes.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.650
Note object, which we haven't created.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.960
Do not to use this provider contact.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.770
That's not what we want.

02:36.340 --> 02:39.070
So let's go ahead and create that first before we move forward.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.890
So what if we go and let's go to a project?

02:42.010 --> 02:43.360
Let's go to our model.

02:43.370 --> 02:48.240
In this case, right click Want to create a new and class?

02:48.250 --> 02:52.060
It's going to be a data class, called his note.

02:52.930 --> 02:59.410
So our note here is going to be very simple now because I want to make this note easy to work with in

02:59.410 --> 02:59.920
the future.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.010
If we choose to do so, I'm going to add needs to save for it.

03:04.210 --> 03:11.290
Now I could come here and start adding perhaps some random numbers each time a note is created and so

03:11.290 --> 03:11.650
forth.

03:12.070 --> 03:18.120
And that's very valid, but there is a really awesome class that we can use that creates random you

03:18.340 --> 03:19.030
IDs.

03:19.770 --> 03:22.240
You ID is universal ID.

03:22.810 --> 03:28.250
So what I can do here in this ID, it's going to be a u u i d type.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.350
This comes from Java you.

03:31.450 --> 03:36.970
If you scroll up, you can see a class that represents an immutable, universal, unique ID.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.420
Universal unique identifier.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.190
I love that great name.

03:42.310 --> 03:42.550
OK.

03:43.330 --> 03:45.210
And you can read more about it and so forth.

03:45.220 --> 03:51.850
So the idea is that this will create very strong ideas that we don't have to worry about ever.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.080
So I'm going to import that.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.980
I'm going to set it to create that UI.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.160
There's different forms here.

03:59.170 --> 04:02.110
I'm just going to use the random, you know, I'd like this.

04:03.160 --> 04:08.320
So each time a note is created, we're going to have something like this.

04:10.720 --> 04:17.620
So anytime you need to create IEDs, random IEDs, you you IEDs like this, which means the AIDS will

04:17.620 --> 04:22.570
never be the same, which is what we want, won't take care of business with you.

04:22.810 --> 04:28.120
You ied that random and next thing I'm going to pass here is going to foul title.

04:28.390 --> 04:32.650
It's going to be just a string next description.

04:36.240 --> 04:45.030
Also, strength, and because we are excited and also just because I'm going to add an entry date here,

04:45.300 --> 04:53.130
so it's going to be I'm going to use local date time travel time there and it will set this to local

04:53.700 --> 04:54.930
date to now.

04:56.340 --> 05:03.030
So what this will do any time that this class is created or an object or this class is intentionally

05:03.030 --> 05:07.620
instantiated to create a note, we're going to have a random ID generated.

05:07.830 --> 05:10.800
We don't have to add ourselves, we can't if we want, but we don't have to.

05:11.130 --> 05:17.520
And then we're going to have the time stamp, which is going to be the time when this was added or created.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.270
Very neat.

05:18.540 --> 05:18.930
That's all.

05:19.470 --> 05:25.440
OK, so now that we have our note, we can go back to our note screen here and uncomment this and this

05:25.440 --> 05:25.910
should work.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.810
Now, let's be careful.

05:26.820 --> 05:27.810
Let's go ahead and import.

05:28.140 --> 05:32.250
Make sure we get our note from our project.

05:32.970 --> 05:33.420
There we go.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.720
What else do you want to do?

05:34.740 --> 05:42.810
Well, for each note to want to be able to, of course, add that note to somewhere, as well as remove

05:42.810 --> 05:43.260
that note?

05:43.880 --> 05:44.130
Right?

05:44.610 --> 05:52.380
So in this case, I'm going to also pass the on add note what I want to happen while I'm going to pass

05:52.830 --> 05:55.650
and note object that needs to be added, obviously.

05:56.040 --> 06:03.400
And in this case, in which case we turn nothing and then only remove note.

06:04.140 --> 06:05.790
I need that note.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.530
So I know what is it?

06:07.530 --> 06:10.470
I'm removing and also return nothing.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.430
All right now, we're going to have an issue.

06:12.430 --> 06:18.960
If you have over here to the right click in our note screen preview here is going to say, Well, I

06:18.960 --> 06:20.640
don't have any notes.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.570
So what's going on?

06:22.200 --> 06:27.180
Well, in this case here, I'm just going to go ahead and say, for instance, for notes, when I say

06:27.450 --> 06:28.110
empty.

06:29.530 --> 06:35.500
List and then for on I'd note, I just put an empty lambada.

06:37.740 --> 06:44.040
Remove also an empty land, therefore, for now, because this is just the preview, so we just going

06:44.040 --> 06:44.640
to pass that.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.570
In fact, also we'll probably have to do the same thing when we go to.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.160
Our main activity, what are we calling for now, I'm just going to say notes.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.740
Say empty.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.440
List

07:03.260 --> 07:11.510
and move note, just past that for now, and also just pass something like that for now, we'll change

07:11.510 --> 07:12.020
all of that.

07:12.560 --> 07:18.230
So back to notes here you'd see that our notes screen now requires a list of notes.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.880
So we need some sort of a list of notes for now.

07:21.890 --> 07:22.670
What are we going to do?

07:22.700 --> 07:26.690
We're going to have dummy data, so stay inside of our data here.

07:26.700 --> 07:31.340
I'm going to say command and write another way of getting there.

07:33.090 --> 07:35.250
This created Class Coughlin class.

07:35.580 --> 07:41.250
It's just going to be a file note data like that.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.890
And here I'm going to just create a class.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.610
All this notes data source.

07:54.030 --> 08:05.040
And just create a function here, say load notes, OK, return a list, yes, of notes, our notes make

08:05.280 --> 08:06.870
very careful what we importing there.

08:07.440 --> 08:11.220
And so now this will return a list of notes.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.640
I said list of that.

08:15.150 --> 08:21.720
Now I do have a lot of notes, so I'm just going to copy all of them and add them here so you don't

08:21.720 --> 08:22.890
have to type it all in.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.980
You also will have access to all of that or you can write them yourself.

08:26.160 --> 08:26.430
OK.

08:26.880 --> 08:31.110
So these are objects of notes which are going to be returned.

08:31.140 --> 08:38.070
So anytime we want to notes, we come to notes, data source and load notes, which should be good.

08:38.490 --> 08:39.480
Maybe not.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.050
There we go.

08:42.060 --> 08:45.960
I think looks like I'm missing something here.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.750
Copy and paste sometime gets you.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.220
OK, there we go.

08:51.270 --> 08:51.620
All right.

08:51.630 --> 08:56.850
So now we have the infrastructure set up so we can continue here.

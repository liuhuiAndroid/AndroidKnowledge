00:00.270 --> 00:03.510
Let's go ahead and set up a room database in our project.

00:03.870 --> 00:06.920
First thing, of course, we need to do is to go to our dependencies again.

00:07.110 --> 00:13.830
This is where we get all the dependencies are needed so we can access the library room oak room database.

00:15.600 --> 00:25.410
I'm going to start with the project are Gradle, and here I'm going to add version I such and the recording

00:26.250 --> 00:26.850
of this.

00:27.420 --> 00:33.330
And at this point, the version is two three two zero.

00:33.540 --> 00:36.840
Remember these change, and so be aware of that.

00:37.470 --> 00:41.040
Let's go back to our app module second one.

00:41.490 --> 00:48.260
And what I usually like to do is, again, I'm going to say a room like this just so I know where we

00:48.260 --> 00:50.190
are putting all of its dependencies for room.

00:51.090 --> 00:56.040
Now how do I know where to start or what dependencies do I need for a room?

00:56.220 --> 00:58.730
Well, we go back to our developer that Andrew.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.500
Com And he can go.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.480
I already have these from previous, right?

01:02.880 --> 01:08.070
So we're putting together the hilt injection dependency injection.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.230
You can actually go here and search.

01:10.320 --> 01:15.990
I'm going to say room database just because that one.

01:18.090 --> 01:19.170
OK, there we go.

01:19.470 --> 01:27.330
And usually here you can see it tells us as of as of this date to that 3.0, that is the current stable

01:27.330 --> 01:29.210
release, OK?

01:29.520 --> 01:36.030
And here it will give you exactly what we need, which indeed is is a dependency for room.

01:36.450 --> 01:40.520
So the first thing we need to add here is going to be the implementation these two.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.760
So I'm going to copy these.

01:44.750 --> 01:49.470
Go back now, remember, we go to our module build.gradle at there.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.220
I'm going to paste all of that there, OK?

01:53.870 --> 01:58.490
And it all works out because we have room version that I've created or earlier.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.490
Let me get rid of all of these below grade or that app.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.460
We said room version and to that 3.0.

02:04.850 --> 02:09.170
OK, so we have this variable per se that it's being used here.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.190
OK, there we go.

02:10.910 --> 02:12.590
Let's see if there's anything else we need.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.660
OK, so there we go.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.040
That should be good.

02:16.880 --> 02:22.220
Now there are a few other dependencies that I'm going to paste and add them here.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.310
These are co-writing.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.050
We'll talk about quarantines and we'll see the power of quarantine.

02:26.070 --> 02:32.810
So these will allow us to do things like running processes outside of main thread, creating different

02:32.810 --> 02:33.730
threads and so forth.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.660
So this is going to be very helpful.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.070
So all what these are.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.580
And by the way, you're going to have access to all of these because this code is going to be hosted.

02:41.030 --> 02:45.620
You have access to this code and I will encourage you to actually go to the code and open the building

02:45.620 --> 02:46.040
Gradle.

02:46.310 --> 02:48.020
So you have exactly what I have here.

02:48.020 --> 02:52.820
So it's essentially here, as you can see six core proteins core for Kotlin.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.280
Well, so let's go ahead and sync.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.180
All right.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.710
It looks like everything went well.

02:57.920 --> 03:03.170
And again, please remember, by the time you're watching this video, these versions will be different,

03:03.650 --> 03:04.390
most likely.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.700
And so you will probably get something like a yellow squiggly line.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.580
If you click on that, you can see you have this light bulb.

03:11.030 --> 03:14.090
That means you can change to the newer version.

03:14.420 --> 03:19.850
OK, it's going to be with all of this, so be aware of that and change to that newer version.

03:20.540 --> 03:20.890
All right.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.670
So everything seems to be fine.

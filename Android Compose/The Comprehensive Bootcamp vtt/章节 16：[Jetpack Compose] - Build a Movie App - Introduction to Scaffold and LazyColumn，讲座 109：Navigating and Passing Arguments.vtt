WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:08.430
So at this point when we click on each one of these lists, right item, we go to details screen and

00:08.880 --> 00:14.190
nothing is really happening because we don't have information right about what we've just clicked.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.700
So the idea is when we click, we want to pass some data.

00:18.060 --> 00:23.250
In this case, I was just going to pass the title of each one of these movies when they are clicked

00:23.610 --> 00:27.270
to show them here and the details page screen.

00:27.930 --> 00:28.650
So how do you do that?

00:28.920 --> 00:31.890
Well, let's go to our movie navigation here.

00:32.730 --> 00:38.940
So if you look at our composable here, this is the composable that describes the details screen.

00:39.290 --> 00:39.400
Right.

00:39.450 --> 00:42.520
So we call this and then we go to detailed screen.

00:42.540 --> 00:46.530
This easy navigation tree like this is a navigation graph.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.300
So what do we need to do?

00:48.420 --> 00:49.260
It's very simple.

00:49.890 --> 00:56.910
All we have to do is to append, because remember this linking that we have here, this navigation is

00:56.910 --> 00:59.230
mimicking how we navigate in the web.

00:59.230 --> 01:05.220
In case we said, pointing to the double double that blue Google Akam.

01:05.220 --> 01:07.410
And then we go to this route, let's say.

01:09.050 --> 01:16.100
Person, but now, but now that we are in this rude person or rather details screen.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.350
All right, just to give an example.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.790
Now what we want to do is we want to pass some parameters when to pass some information.

01:24.790 --> 01:29.260
So and the way we would have to have something like this is idea is equal.

01:29.650 --> 01:30.310
Thirty four.

01:30.610 --> 01:32.400
So now we're going to pass some data.

01:32.410 --> 01:34.300
This is part of the data we're going to pass.

01:34.720 --> 01:41.710
All we do is to append, as you see here, we're going to append, for example, and then the information

01:41.710 --> 01:42.070
we want.

01:42.940 --> 01:51.010
So that's eight plus and put double quotes for Slash, and then I'm going to put inside of curly braces.

01:51.260 --> 01:52.090
It's very important.

01:52.540 --> 01:58.480
In this case, I'm going to name the value or the variable that's going to be holding the information.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.940
Let's just say movie for now.

02:01.660 --> 02:07.510
Now we also can has more information about this argument that we're passing.

02:07.900 --> 02:13.630
If you hover over in composable, you can see it has the root parameter which would pass.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.050
And then we have the arguments which you see here.

02:17.050 --> 02:19.060
It's going to be a list of named arguments.

02:20.230 --> 02:24.220
Now, if we don't do anything right now, just leave like that.

02:24.220 --> 02:27.220
So we actually add the arguments, right?

02:27.640 --> 02:32.620
It's going to be OK because the default argument type is always going to be string.

02:33.190 --> 02:38.320
However, I'm going to pass it here so that you know how to do, and I will recommend that you do this

02:38.800 --> 02:41.390
whenever, whenever you wanted to pass arguments.

02:41.410 --> 02:42.400
So I said arguments.

02:42.670 --> 02:47.050
In this case, I'm going to make a list of who can pass a list of arguments.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.810
And here once they have arguments.

02:49.930 --> 02:53.420
So this is the type function we're going to pass and it's not here.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.050
I'm going to pass the name of the argument.

02:55.090 --> 03:01.630
The name is going to be movie has to be exactly the same or passed it, the Senate that we passed there.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.950
And after that, I'm going to pass the actual type, someone say type.

03:10.800 --> 03:19.260
Said that two NAF type string type like this and you can see if I say NAF type, you can see if I say

03:19.260 --> 03:20.070
NAF type.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.520
Click there are all these different types within pass.

03:24.540 --> 03:24.690
Right?

03:25.350 --> 03:26.820
For now, this one string type.

03:27.690 --> 03:31.380
So what we're saying here again, is that the arguments that we're expecting is going to be a list,

03:31.380 --> 03:33.600
even though Dallas only has one item that's OK.

03:33.990 --> 03:38.520
I will pass it NAF argument, which is going to be a movie and then the type is going to be a string

03:38.520 --> 03:38.850
type.

03:40.370 --> 03:40.720
OK.

03:40.860 --> 03:41.240
Target.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.010
So at this point, here we are.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.780
We establish this connection, we say we do have the argument we're going to pass, which is going to

03:47.780 --> 03:50.110
be movie and the type is string.

03:51.620 --> 03:55.730
Now, once we get there, they are being inside of detailed screen.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.100
How do we how do we then retrieve that information in this case, the information we're going to be

04:01.100 --> 04:02.840
passing from this argument?

04:04.010 --> 04:12.800
If you look at how alarmed to hear this is the composable that we have here, access to this NAF back

04:12.950 --> 04:14.030
stack entry.

04:15.200 --> 04:23.230
So I'm going to actually put that in your line and say Max stack entry.

04:23.300 --> 04:30.800
So what this is, really it's going to be it will what this is is a veritable that contains the information

04:30.800 --> 04:31.310
we want.

04:31.730 --> 04:35.090
For instance, we can go and get the arguments, values and so forth.

04:35.510 --> 04:39.920
And that's handy because then we can pass that into our detailed screen, which is exactly what we want

04:40.310 --> 04:40.790
in this case.

04:40.790 --> 04:46.610
Here, I can just go ahead and say something like this pack back, string back, stack entry.

04:47.210 --> 04:48.350
I'm going to see arguments.

04:48.650 --> 04:53.930
I have access with arguments and in this case here because it's knowable and just put.

04:54.710 --> 04:58.160
And then I'm going to get string like this.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.890
OK, what string?

05:01.130 --> 05:02.450
I'm going to get the key.

05:02.930 --> 05:05.180
It's going to be movie.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.280
OK.

05:06.320 --> 05:06.860
There it is.

05:07.190 --> 05:12.950
Now we're going to have an issue here because if you have over, we haven't specified in our details.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.620
Let's go ahead and click here.

05:16.580 --> 05:22.100
We need to actually add a parameter to function details screen to say, OK, we are expecting to receive

05:22.100 --> 05:23.780
something in this case, just going to be a string.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.490
So, OK, just click that.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.180
And if you go to details, you can see now that was added there.

05:29.390 --> 05:34.240
So in this case, instead of just string, let's call this OK, this is knowable.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.350
That's why we have the exclamation point.

05:37.470 --> 05:37.850
All right.

05:37.890 --> 05:42.390
So now I can just pass that movie data.

05:44.320 --> 05:52.690
Saying all the data such and because it's not a bill, I'll have to probably surround that or let's

05:52.690 --> 05:56.590
just call to string it, that will solve the problem.

05:59.130 --> 06:09.450
OK, there we have, but we're not done yet because we've set up the mechanism to pass data from homescreen

06:09.450 --> 06:10.110
to details.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.380
Now we have to actually pass the actual data.

06:13.390 --> 06:14.370
Where do we pass that?

06:14.400 --> 06:19.950
Well, remember we have inside of our home screen, inside of our lazy column.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.560
We have more row and we have that lambda.

06:23.100 --> 06:27.000
Whatever we are clicking this case, this is going to be the name of the movie.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.730
In fact, they can change this to say.

06:31.190 --> 06:37.520
Movie night in this case, here I am just going to pass through.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.000
And now we have this navigate, we're passing the route.

06:41.030 --> 06:43.130
Look at this detail screen that name.

06:43.520 --> 06:48.290
That means that I can pass it just like we would do in the web.

06:48.690 --> 06:57.680
I'm going to say plus to concatenate right and then forward slash like this and pass our movie string

06:57.680 --> 06:57.980
here.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.160
Make sure you do add forward slash, because remember, this is almost like a link, right?

07:04.730 --> 07:07.700
Saying that we're passing this argument into our route.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.330
Right.

07:10.350 --> 07:10.800
There it is.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.600
So now let's go ahead and run this.

07:14.270 --> 07:14.650
OK.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.500
Moment of truth.

07:15.630 --> 07:19.220
If I click Avatar, oops, it looks like we were having some issues.

07:19.850 --> 07:22.520
Let's go to Iran and see what the problem might be.

07:23.510 --> 07:28.490
Looks like unsupported exception arrays don't support default values.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.460
Maybe I passed the wrong.

07:34.950 --> 07:35.400
You're right.

07:35.430 --> 07:36.220
This is the problem.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.180
This is supposed to be string type, not that string array.

07:39.450 --> 07:44.130
I had it before, but I think I'm I mistyped and I did the wrong type.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.660
That's the problem, right?

07:45.660 --> 07:48.240
But says arrays don't support default values.

07:48.420 --> 07:49.230
There was a problem.

07:49.450 --> 07:50.100
It would be good.

07:50.550 --> 07:51.600
Types are very important.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.220
OK, let's go ahead and run again.

07:53.970 --> 07:57.930
This time, we should hopefully be able to see good results.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.190
Click 300.

07:59.400 --> 07:59.940
There it is.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.150
And let's click Harry Potter.

08:03.930 --> 08:09.990
OK, so we are able to pass information through our navigation, which is really exciting.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.270
Now you can see you can do all sorts of things right.

08:12.270 --> 08:17.400
The idea is, for instance, if this were an object, a moving object, it would have more than just

08:17.400 --> 08:17.850
a title.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.410
Then we would pass to Andy.

08:19.410 --> 08:27.780
And then when we get here, get ready and get now the object information more fields and we can't populate

08:27.780 --> 08:31.350
here to create the sense that to create that detailed speech.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.960
And here what we can do is put that inside of a surface.

08:38.190 --> 08:39.000
And.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.480
Put that inside there.

08:44.860 --> 08:46.750
Remove all of that and.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.190
Pass the modifier.

08:57.790 --> 08:58.620
Max height.

09:01.540 --> 09:05.110
Max width, OK.

09:05.290 --> 09:09.370
And then we can make this, perhaps, let's say.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.470
Give her a style, say, material

09:22.200 --> 09:26.460
theme typography as Page Five, that's fine.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.050
And if he wanted, we can just put this inside of a column.

09:37.270 --> 09:48.940
And get all of that and put in the middle there, say horizontal alignment, center, horizontal and

09:49.180 --> 09:51.100
vertical arrangement.

09:51.940 --> 09:55.110
I want that to be center, right?

09:55.180 --> 09:59.050
This is just play at this point to see what we can get here.

10:02.950 --> 10:03.610
And there you have it.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.530
So now it's in the middle there.

10:06.400 --> 10:06.920
All right.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.750
This is real good.

10:08.660 --> 10:14.020
Let's go back happiness and we are passing the correct data.

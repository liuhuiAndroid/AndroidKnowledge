WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:06.600
So let's go ahead and start putting together the structure here, so we're going to start with the icon

00:06.600 --> 00:10.560
first and then this star and the rating.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.470
OK, so all of that's going to be, of course, inside of our column here.

00:14.490 --> 00:18.330
So first of all, for our column, I'm going to change a few things here.

00:19.630 --> 00:21.550
So I'm going to say.

00:23.940 --> 00:24.990
How did my fire?

00:29.100 --> 00:33.090
And I want the padding, the top padding.

00:36.940 --> 00:48.310
To be about twenty five deep and then vertical arrangement, I want us to be center and horizontal arrangement.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.430
I want center horizontally like this.

00:52.630 --> 00:59.570
And now inside here, that's where I'm going to add the icon this heart first.

00:59.590 --> 01:04.360
So let's go ahead and say icon going to use the image factor.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.370
When to use our icons.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.140
Just use default.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.010
Well rounded.

01:11.020 --> 01:11.740
That's fine.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.550
And where he used a favorite border like this.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.460
And of course, we need to pass a description.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.360
They've icon

01:27.540 --> 01:35.070
and passing modifiers to just modify a few things here and say, mighty fire, just keep it padding

01:35.340 --> 01:37.650
bottom padding that is of about one dpi.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.080
OK, pretty good.

01:40.170 --> 01:44.910
So now if you look at our code, you can see we have that very nice.

01:46.130 --> 01:50.930
Heart there next to let's go ahead and create and look at this structure here.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.150
It's going to be its own structure per se.

01:53.690 --> 01:56.810
That means this is going to be right after a hurricane.

01:56.840 --> 02:07.190
I'm going to call book rating, which is going to expect a score of, let's say, three that five to

02:07.190 --> 02:07.760
begin with.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.610
And let's go ahead and create this composable.

02:11.510 --> 02:11.970
There we go.

02:11.990 --> 02:19.790
So I'm just going to have 4.5 as a default and in our book rating here, what we want to do.

02:19.790 --> 02:25.130
First of all, we're going to create a surface like that and add a modifier

02:27.530 --> 02:30.110
height in this case of about 70

02:32.570 --> 02:35.810
and padding overall padding about four dpi.

02:37.490 --> 02:43.820
And let's go ahead and add a a shape, right?

02:43.910 --> 02:47.720
Because we want a shape like this and let's get rid of that.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.490
You can see the exact shape there.

02:50.210 --> 02:59.510
So rounded corners shape and I'm going to give a fifty six dpi percentage so really well rounded as

02:59.510 --> 03:00.050
you see there.

03:00.290 --> 03:00.620
OK.

03:04.150 --> 03:12.190
I'm going to give an elevation of about six deep and the civic color, they color dark white.

03:13.300 --> 03:17.070
So if you look at this, you'll see that indeed, we have two items inside.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.490
We have to star and then they sort out zero or in this case, the rating.

03:22.010 --> 03:26.110
So let's create a column pass a modifier again.

03:29.210 --> 03:37.220
Overall pattern of buy for deep, and that should be OK for now, and we're going to pass an icon again.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.380
And it's going to be icons.

03:39.530 --> 03:40.490
I say default.

03:42.050 --> 03:45.530
Let's say field if you want.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.720
Doesn't matter really when I say star.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.140
And how about.

03:54.190 --> 04:00.640
Start a border like this one night and I can say start for a content description.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.380
Let's pass in modifier internally.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.740
Let's keep the padding of about three deep.

04:14.150 --> 04:20.930
And then we're going to add a text right below it, which is going to be our scores going to this score

04:22.130 --> 04:24.170
that to string like that.

04:24.350 --> 04:28.400
This style it a little bit using material theme.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.550
And typography subtitle one like this.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.590
All right, let's go and split.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.680
It's refresh real quick.

04:44.120 --> 04:49.800
And just like that, you see, we have this nice structure there.

04:49.820 --> 04:50.540
It looks really good.

04:50.780 --> 04:51.530
I love it.

04:51.770 --> 04:52.160
OK.

04:52.310 --> 04:53.630
So it is indeed working.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.640
So it looks pretty much something like this.

04:55.970 --> 04:56.750
That's really good.

04:57.170 --> 04:57.620
All right.

04:59.030 --> 04:59.990
OK, so what's next?

05:00.050 --> 05:03.560
Well, next, we need to look at this section here.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.300
Where are we going to have the title of the book?

05:05.660 --> 05:08.840
And, of course, potential writers.

05:09.320 --> 05:14.750
So very simply, let's go back to code where we call.

05:15.050 --> 05:17.390
So now we're back into our card.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.230
OK.

05:19.400 --> 05:25.220
So after a book reading, we've added that and outside of our role because it has to be still inside

05:25.220 --> 05:26.780
of a column, right?

05:27.710 --> 05:28.940
So this is.

05:30.480 --> 05:37.380
There were no or we have to book and the structure now we're going to go outside still in this column

05:37.380 --> 05:39.900
and create yet this structure there.

05:41.130 --> 05:45.150
So let's see, that's our role outside of that role.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.770
I want to create a text.

05:47.790 --> 05:50.400
This is going to say book title.

05:53.310 --> 05:54.510
Passing modifier.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.530
Overall padding.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.150
Let's say font weight.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.940
And I want this to be bold.

06:14.210 --> 06:24.050
Max lines, I want this to be at least two lines, OK, because the book title could be long and overflow.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.830
I'm going to add an overflow here because we don't have a lot because we don't have a lot of space,

06:28.840 --> 06:32.440
something I just see text overflow ellipses.

06:33.050 --> 06:40.250
I see ellipses like this so we can have something like dot dot if the text is too long.

06:42.170 --> 06:42.490
OK.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.910
That's should be good.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.700
And then let's create another text.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.990
And this one is going to be authors like this.

06:51.350 --> 06:53.680
And are you going to say modifier?

06:53.690 --> 06:54.560
Of course.

06:58.050 --> 07:07.520
Padding by four deep and give it a style material theme.

07:09.860 --> 07:10.980
Let's go back.

07:19.470 --> 07:23.190
Typography, and I'm going to make it caption, OK.

07:23.310 --> 07:23.760
All right, good.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.200
Let's take a look.

07:27.860 --> 07:29.180
Very nice, so there it is.

07:29.990 --> 07:33.650
We have the book title goes here and authors will go here.

07:34.130 --> 07:34.640
Very good.

07:34.650 --> 07:35.660
So making good progress.

07:36.950 --> 07:37.280
All right.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.970
So the next thing we need to do is to create this nice structure there.

07:41.090 --> 07:41.300
Right.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.380
So it's really nice.

07:42.620 --> 07:50.160
So it looks like it's a rounded corners shape there and it's going to be on top of our main structure.

07:50.180 --> 07:53.300
Main card OK, so we're going to do that in the next video.

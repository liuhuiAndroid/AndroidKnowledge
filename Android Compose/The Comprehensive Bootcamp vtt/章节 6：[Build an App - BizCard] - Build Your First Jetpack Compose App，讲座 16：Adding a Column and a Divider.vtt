WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:06.870
Because we are looking ahead and seeing exactly how all of these pieces of the user interface are going

00:06.870 --> 00:07.740
to be laid out.

00:07.770 --> 00:11.250
We understand that we have at the top here the image, which is this one, it doesn't look that great

00:11.250 --> 00:12.730
yet, but we'll get there.

00:12.830 --> 00:14.460
Then we have the names actually.

00:14.460 --> 00:19.080
Before that, we have this divider and then we have names and all this information.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.620
So how do we lay things out as such, right?

00:22.620 --> 00:26.130
Because this is a vertical layout, if you will.

00:26.430 --> 00:29.420
Well, we can do that by using a column.

00:29.430 --> 00:34.200
So a column is yet another composable function that allows us to lay things out vertically.

00:34.470 --> 00:42.040
So what we need to do is inside of our card before we start putting together a surface and so forth.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.020
We're going to do this.

00:43.020 --> 00:49.090
We are going to add a column of, say, column start typing column like such an overlap.

00:49.380 --> 00:55.590
So this column here we can pass, of course, modifiers and other properties parameters that will modify

00:55.590 --> 01:00.240
or will know how to layout this column or the contents of this column.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.630
So what do we need to do next is get all of this information here.

01:03.690 --> 01:08.970
Our surface, which is at this point, the image and cut that we're put inside of his column.

01:09.450 --> 01:10.810
Now we have that problem there.

01:10.830 --> 01:11.310
That's OK.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.090
We'll get there.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.460
So what do we want to make sure that happen?

01:14.460 --> 01:20.490
Is that his column, we can modify it or we can make it so that he knows exactly how to lay its children

01:20.520 --> 01:20.880
out.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.550
So what are the children of this column?

01:23.580 --> 01:25.290
Well, in this case, we just have one child.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.490
Well, actually three two, that is surface.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.430
And then we have the image.

01:29.580 --> 01:30.900
But are we going to have other things here?

01:30.930 --> 01:37.380
So instead of our column here, we're going to pass another modifier modifier such and then I'm going

01:37.380 --> 01:43.430
to say that I want the height total height of all of this contents inside here of about 300 db.

01:43.890 --> 01:44.160
OK.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.090
That's very good.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.820
And the other thing I want to do notice I'm outside the modifier now.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.010
This is a different property.

01:50.010 --> 01:50.790
I'm going to be passing.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.370
There's a property called vertical arrangement.

01:53.400 --> 01:59.100
This is very important because we can specify how do we want these items inside of his column to be

01:59.100 --> 02:00.270
arranged vertically?

02:00.750 --> 02:01.020
Right?

02:01.320 --> 02:07.800
So when I say arrange ment like this and we have a few options, well, we want from top to bottom.

02:08.080 --> 02:08.850
OK, that's fine.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.430
But there's another one, too, which is horizontally.

02:11.430 --> 02:15.120
How do we want all of these items inside here to be indeed laid out?

02:15.210 --> 02:21.690
And when, say, horizontally, I want all these items to be aligned, say our alignment center horizontally,

02:21.810 --> 02:24.000
like so in the middle, but horizontally center.

02:24.570 --> 02:25.200
OK, let's see.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.910
Let's build and refresh.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.790
And the moment you do that, something happens.

02:29.820 --> 02:36.390
Everything changes all the difficulties we're having, which meant we were having this whole profile

02:36.390 --> 02:38.850
picture, taking the entire view.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.410
Now, it no longer does that because we wrapped it inside of a column.

02:43.410 --> 02:48.330
So we are now saying, well, whatever we have inside of this surface, which in this case is the image,

02:48.780 --> 02:56.670
it's going to take mainly the parents arrangements, if you will, of how to be displayed inside of

02:56.670 --> 02:57.210
itself.

02:57.510 --> 03:02.820
And I can see that solving a problem because it no longer is outside by its own.

03:03.030 --> 03:07.170
It's inside of a column and we've arranged things to be laid out.

03:07.170 --> 03:10.380
How they will be laid out inside of his column might really good.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.300
OK, so this is exactly what we want.

03:12.540 --> 03:17.340
In fact, if I show you here side by side, you can see it is indeed what we want.

03:17.970 --> 03:18.260
All right.

03:18.420 --> 03:23.130
So next up is let's go ahead and see if we can add this divider here.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.060
How do we do that?

03:24.330 --> 03:28.830
Well, before we move forward, there's another concept I need to show you real quick here.

03:29.010 --> 03:29.290
OK?

03:29.310 --> 03:32.450
And again, we will go into details at a later time.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.040
This is just for us to get situated with compose.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.690
The process is very simple.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.820
Sure, everything is working fine.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.400
We're able to see default previews and everything is great.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.840
But you notice that our code is starting to get a little bit cramped together, right?

03:46.350 --> 03:48.210
It's always a good way of coding.

03:48.210 --> 03:54.930
If we can create pieces of user interfaces that can then be called so that they are a little bit independent,

03:55.080 --> 04:00.600
which means we can actually remove this entire surface here, right?

04:00.600 --> 04:03.570
Which in this case contain this image outside here.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.060
Right that way, it's its own entity.

04:06.270 --> 04:11.220
In fact, if you look here, let me go ahead and minimize this a little bit.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.930
We have our surface here.

04:13.170 --> 04:18.360
What I can do is I'm gonna go ahead and select all of this.

04:18.510 --> 04:19.410
Let's right click.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.360
I'm going to go to refactor.

04:21.630 --> 04:25.740
I'm going to go to a function to create its own function, and it's analyzing everything.

04:25.740 --> 04:30.480
And now what I'm going to do, I'm going to name this whole function right, because it's going to extract

04:30.480 --> 04:33.900
this into a different function, a composable, as you see there.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.180
So I'm going to call this this call.

04:36.180 --> 04:41.900
This create image profile like this hit enter and just like magic.

04:41.960 --> 04:48.360
Notice now it's just calling create image profile there, and the composable is outside here on its

04:48.360 --> 04:48.630
own.

04:48.990 --> 04:49.350
All right.

04:50.010 --> 04:50.670
They have it in.

04:50.670 --> 04:56.280
So if we go ahead and of course, building refresh again, nothing will have changed in terms of what

04:56.280 --> 04:56.790
we see.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.550
But we know that we have compartmentalize our code a little bit.

05:00.290 --> 05:05.270
As you see, everything is still the same, but again, the code is a little bit different in that we

05:05.270 --> 05:07.250
have compromise our code.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.290
We created a different piece.

05:10.020 --> 05:16.060
Different composable function that sits on its own and can be called upon as you see there.

05:16.440 --> 05:22.580
OK, and anything we can do, we can also obviously parse parameters to these create image profile so

05:22.580 --> 05:29.200
we can make this image profile more independent per se more customizable, one of which is to pass the

05:29.210 --> 05:32.900
modifiers and let's say modifier like that going to make it a modifier.

05:33.230 --> 05:37.580
Now, if I leave it as it is right now, notice is going to have a problem because it going to say we

05:37.580 --> 05:40.080
need to pass them under fire for an order for this to work.

05:40.100 --> 05:46.340
But we can also say that, you know what, we are not going to require this modifier to be passed along,

05:46.340 --> 05:51.590
meaning if we want to call create image profile, it's an option to add a modifier.

05:51.680 --> 05:57.260
How do we do that to make it an optional, which I say is equal to modifier like this?

05:57.680 --> 06:00.620
The moment you do that notice we can call create image profile.

06:00.860 --> 06:05.330
We can obviously pass a modifier five over can see, says Modifier.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.360
It's an option to pass it as a parameter, but it's not required.

06:08.590 --> 06:08.930
All right.

06:09.410 --> 06:16.040
So that means that if indeed something is passed along, what we can do, we can use that modifier variable

06:16.040 --> 06:22.280
parameter and invoke inside our surface or anywhere else that's needed inside here.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.570
But for now, we're just going to keep it as a race because that's not the idea of showing you this,

06:26.630 --> 06:30.170
but just to get you thinking a little bit about what can be done.

06:30.260 --> 06:30.980
All right, there we go.

06:31.250 --> 06:37.370
So again, nothing really will change if I refresh everything, and that's always a good news.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.930
OK, what is next there?

06:38.930 --> 06:40.210
We want to do next.

06:40.220 --> 06:43.640
We want to add this divider here.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.210
Very good.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.620
How do we do this?

06:45.650 --> 06:46.370
You may ask.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.630
Well, it's very simple.

06:47.840 --> 06:54.020
So right below there, I'm going to just say something like, yes, there is a composable I can call

06:54.020 --> 06:55.100
call divider.

06:55.370 --> 06:55.880
Look at that.

06:56.060 --> 06:58.400
And the divider, if you hit enter, there it is.

06:58.400 --> 07:03.740
If you have over again, like any other composable that comes with jetpack compose, we haven't created

07:03.740 --> 07:04.370
this ourselves.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.100
It's just prebuilt for us to use again.

07:07.430 --> 07:12.130
Notice modifier we can pass modifier so we can modify just like any other composer.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.130
Composable, I should say.

07:13.250 --> 07:13.490
All right.

07:13.910 --> 07:16.790
So we can pass the color thickness and start indent.

07:17.120 --> 07:22.250
And he also tells us a divider is a thin line that groups content enlists in layout.

07:22.760 --> 07:23.060
OK.

07:23.570 --> 07:28.150
So if we leave, as is right now, let's go ahead and refresh.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.060
See what's going to happen.

07:29.450 --> 07:33.230
It should have some default values that comes with so we don't have to worry about.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.950
And then if you want to change thickness, you can change the color.

07:36.980 --> 07:37.760
We can do so.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.620
But for now, let's see what's going to happen.

07:39.980 --> 07:42.680
And while I can see there it is, it's very, very, very small.

07:42.690 --> 07:46.250
I'm going to just zoom in, exaggerate things a little bit.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.510
So hopefully you can see.

07:47.960 --> 07:48.680
And there it is.

07:48.980 --> 07:49.280
OK.

07:49.790 --> 07:50.360
It's there.

07:50.930 --> 07:51.590
And there you have it.

07:52.250 --> 07:52.640
All right.

07:53.180 --> 07:53.600
Very good.

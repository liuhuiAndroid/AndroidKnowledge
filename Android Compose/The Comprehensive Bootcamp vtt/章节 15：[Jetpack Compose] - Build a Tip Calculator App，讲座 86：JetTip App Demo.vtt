Welcome to this new section, I'm very excited that you're here, so as you know, the whole point of

00:05.640 --> 00:11.970
this course is to get you going with composed jetpack compose, which means that we're going to be building

00:11.970 --> 00:12.540
things.

00:12.930 --> 00:18.450
OK, so I don't want to make this a boring situation where you just are learning concepts, but we are

00:18.450 --> 00:21.120
going to be building things and we learn that way.

00:21.420 --> 00:24.690
So, OK, so what is there going to be building next?

00:25.050 --> 00:28.440
Well, next, we're going to be building this awesome jet.

00:28.680 --> 00:34.440
This awesome tip application because the world needs another tape app.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.280
But the idea really here is to, of course, to go through the process of putting together a full fledged

00:41.670 --> 00:47.890
compose app and learn about other kinds of composable functions which are widgets and so forth.

00:47.910 --> 00:50.760
So that's the whole idea of how we do that.

00:51.210 --> 00:56.040
And so now I'm going to show you a live demo of this app.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.200
So the idea is very simple.

00:58.290 --> 01:04.710
When you first open the app, you will be prompted with adding some sort of a bill.

01:04.860 --> 01:05.160
OK.

01:05.670 --> 01:09.390
And so in this case, here, it can go ahead and change the split amount.

01:09.400 --> 01:16.290
So if you are going to dinner with a few friends or a friend, you can put the amount the entire bill,

01:16.680 --> 01:17.910
which is 100 in this case.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.330
And then we want to split by two or two people.

01:22.020 --> 01:26.470
And then, of course, right away, you can also slide left and right.

01:26.470 --> 01:32.760
You have a nice slider here, and this will determine what amount of tip we want to give you.

01:32.970 --> 01:33.900
Services, well, good.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.520
And it can go, let's say, about three, OK?

01:37.950 --> 01:41.850
And that just tells us at the top there you can see right here.

01:42.970 --> 01:50.290
He tells us at the top there the total per person, so for two people, $100 and we want to tip 33 percent.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.750
We can add 33 to 100.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.670
That's 133 divided by two.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.520
It's 66 50.

01:56.950 --> 02:01.780
OK, and we can add, of course, depending on how many people decided to join the party.

02:02.230 --> 02:06.040
We can keep adding the split in this case.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.470
Five, you can see the numbers are changing.

02:08.470 --> 02:11.500
The amount per person that has to pay is always changing.

02:11.800 --> 02:18.370
If we decide that you know it's just us tonight, one person, there's one in Whyalla.

02:18.910 --> 02:20.980
This is the whole amount that we will have to pay.

02:22.050 --> 02:28.020
So there are a lot of moving parts here, not only the user interface, but also the logic behind it

02:28.410 --> 02:30.660
in how to put together such things and compose.

02:30.780 --> 02:33.600
So this is what are we going to be doing next?

02:33.900 --> 02:35.760
And let's go ahead and get started.

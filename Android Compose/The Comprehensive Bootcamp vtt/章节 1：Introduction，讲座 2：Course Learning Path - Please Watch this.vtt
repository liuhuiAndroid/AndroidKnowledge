00:00.480 --> 00:05.430
So let's talk about the course of learning path now and this course, because I want to make sure that

00:05.430 --> 00:10.260
it's a comprehensive course right for everybody to actually get the most out of this.

00:10.440 --> 00:16.830
I have two sections, so there is the first part which is going to be because Compose uses Catling,

00:16.830 --> 00:18.900
so it's important that you understand codling.

00:18.900 --> 00:26.680
So I will include sections with full of information about Kathleen, from fundamentals to intermediate

00:26.700 --> 00:28.440
in a little bit advanced concepts.

00:28.620 --> 00:34.920
So that will aid you to understand better how COMPOSE is used to build Android applications.

00:35.190 --> 00:37.380
And the other part is a jetpack compose.

00:37.380 --> 00:41.370
So this is where we're going to be building Android apps using Jetpack Compose.

00:41.550 --> 00:45.210
Now the great thing here, because this is a video course, right?

00:45.320 --> 00:47.070
Know all of this is our online course.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.250
There's videos that you can watch whenever you want to watch them.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.880
That's the beauty.

00:50.970 --> 00:56.550
You are not required to watch everything, especially when it comes to codling fundamentals.

00:56.700 --> 01:02.490
Could be that you already know Kotlin and you are well versed with Kotlin, so obviously you won't need

01:02.490 --> 01:04.410
to watch codling fundamental section.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.660
So this is purely optional.

01:06.720 --> 01:14.370
However, I would recommend anyone to go through the Kotlin fundamentals just to brush up on the fundamentals

01:14.370 --> 01:19.230
of Kotlin, because there's always something that you missed or something that perhaps you forgotten,

01:19.230 --> 01:21.350
and it doesn't hurt to go through.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.200
What do you feel like you should know about codling, right?

01:24.210 --> 01:29.840
So you can peruse through and find it the topics that you are wanting to brush up on?

01:30.890 --> 01:34.760
For those of you who have never done programming or have done some programming in different languages

01:34.850 --> 01:40.280
and don't know coupling that well, then obviously I recommend you to go through the codling fundamentals

01:40.280 --> 01:46.670
before you jump onto the jetpack compose because that way jetpack compose will be much easier to grasp

01:46.970 --> 01:48.380
if you understand codling.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.040
All right.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.030
OK, very good.

01:50.150 --> 01:52.310
I'm very excited and I'll see you in the next video.

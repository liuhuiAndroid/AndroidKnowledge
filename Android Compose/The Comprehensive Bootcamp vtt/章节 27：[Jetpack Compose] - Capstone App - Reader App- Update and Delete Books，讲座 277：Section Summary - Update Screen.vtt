00:00.130 --> 00:02.290
Right, so lots of progress.

00:02.340 --> 00:04.320
We just finished update screen.

00:04.410 --> 00:09.370
So we're able to do a lot of things here, constructed this entire update structure.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.300
The screen here at the top, we have the book we have.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.250
Enter your thoughts text field.

00:14.520 --> 00:21.530
We're able to toggle between started date and mark as read and get that logic going there.

00:21.570 --> 00:27.570
And we have this nice reading bar that we created with a very cool animation there.

00:27.600 --> 00:32.940
Of course, we're able to update this book, and we were also able to delete the book right?

00:32.950 --> 00:39.100
And all of that happens live the front end, but then propagate it into the back end to actually delete

00:39.100 --> 00:39.390
the book.

00:39.600 --> 00:46.620
And we follow this strict user experience architecture where we pop up a message saying, OK, are you

00:46.620 --> 00:51.960
sure you want to delete this to give the user a chance to back out of this decision if they wish to

00:51.960 --> 00:52.340
do so?

00:52.340 --> 00:58.740
OK, so we are done with our update and now we're going to go back to homescreen because we need to

00:58.740 --> 01:00.600
restructure a few things there.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.370
All right, let's go ahead and do that.

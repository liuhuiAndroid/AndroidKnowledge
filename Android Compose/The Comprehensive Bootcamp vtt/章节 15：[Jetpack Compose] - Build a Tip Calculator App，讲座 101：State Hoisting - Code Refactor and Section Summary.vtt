00:01.150 --> 00:07.390
The app is pretty much done, which is wonderful news, but if you look at the bill, form can see that

00:07.390 --> 00:13.330
we have a lot of state inside of this class that are attached to bill form.

00:13.360 --> 00:18.370
Now the thing that we've learned earlier and we should always keep in mind is that it is a very good

00:18.370 --> 00:25.990
idea to always hoist this state up to the calling of function or to call in composable meaning that

00:25.990 --> 00:29.470
bill form is being called where, well, it's being called is being called.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.080
Instead of main content.

00:31.620 --> 00:37.630
We should hoist some of the state to main content and again understand that sometimes that may not be

00:37.630 --> 00:40.090
possible depending on the structure of your code.

00:40.330 --> 00:40.880
That's OK.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.630
But this is something that you should always keep in mind.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.750
So let's see if we can host some of these.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.340
Values or some of these states.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.580
So the first thing I'm going to do notice or bill form here, and we have modified which we haven't

00:56.580 --> 01:02.400
used a default argument here to say that if something is passed, that's fine.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.200
If not, we're just going to pass a default one.

01:04.530 --> 01:05.550
This is what it means.

01:05.970 --> 01:06.170
OK?

01:06.780 --> 01:08.790
And then we're passing on value change.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.530
That's reason why we're able to do this.

01:10.950 --> 01:12.690
This was just for testing purposes.

01:12.900 --> 01:17.760
We can pass the bill and do all sorts of things, but we want to be able to hoist some of this state

01:17.760 --> 01:23.460
to put inside of our main content because this is the composable that's calling our bill form.

01:23.470 --> 01:28.830
So it's just separate or to make this bill form relatively stateless.

01:29.010 --> 01:35.730
We were not going to be able to do fully stateless, but at least a relatively stateless list hosts

01:35.730 --> 01:36.570
some of these guys.

01:37.110 --> 01:42.180
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass a few parameters or arguments here.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.230
I'm going to say, first of all, is going to be range is going to be an inch range.

01:46.790 --> 01:50.620
When I said it to between one and 100.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.850
So what I'm doing here is that we're going to use this range in a second here.

01:54.180 --> 01:54.980
What are we doing here?

01:54.990 --> 01:59.670
I'm saying I want to create a range which is going to be used, you know, a slider here.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.530
This is going to be between one and 100.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.570
This is how we do it in codling.

02:04.680 --> 02:04.950
All right.

02:04.950 --> 02:09.240
So the next thing we are going to pass, it's going to be this split by.

02:11.160 --> 02:16.890
State and since I'm going to be passing it as a state, which means we will have to create it somewhere.

02:17.710 --> 02:24.660
Might the calling function, I'm going to say mutable, I'm going to put past the type immutable state.

02:28.470 --> 02:35.370
Such and I need to say the type that it's expecting inside of these angle brackets, so the type is

02:35.370 --> 02:40.900
going to be into such good, the next is going to be tip amount.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.020
State.

02:45.050 --> 02:46.880
It's going to be the same thing, immutable state.

02:47.450 --> 02:50.410
This case is going to be a double OK.

02:51.320 --> 02:57.140
And in total, for a person, it's going to be a mutable state again.

02:57.830 --> 02:59.390
Also a double like this.

03:00.170 --> 03:02.990
Let's change this one state says state like that.

03:04.070 --> 03:11.390
And now you can see if you go down here, you can see we have all of these that indeed can be changed.

03:11.630 --> 03:18.350
So at this point, I'm going to just go ahead and cut all of this as such, and we're going to move

03:18.350 --> 03:20.690
all of that to the calling function like this.

03:23.180 --> 03:26.030
And then we're going to pass that through here.

03:26.390 --> 03:28.950
So the first thing, let's say, let's start here.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.900
So let's start with split by state.

03:32.990 --> 03:38.180
I'm going to pass this split by state, OK?

03:38.630 --> 03:46.220
And then let's say tip a Mount St. Mary pass tip and Mount St. like that and total per person states

03:46.220 --> 03:48.980
and be able to total per person state such.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.390
So we have this land there.

03:50.660 --> 03:51.740
We don't really need it.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.840
So I'm going to just get rid of that altogether.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.340
Or in pass, nothing like this for our bill form.

04:00.730 --> 04:07.090
So now we have hoisted some of these states to the calling composable function.

04:08.220 --> 04:10.620
We didn't do all of them, but at least we did some of them.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.900
Now you see the Rangers not being used.

04:12.960 --> 04:20.670
This is, of course, optional in that if you go back to our bill form, you know, range here, if

04:20.670 --> 04:25.560
you don't pass anything, we have a default value, which is 100, one to 100.

04:26.070 --> 04:32.400
Of course, if you want to make this even more so, I can say something like this range and against

04:32.410 --> 04:36.030
say range like that.

04:36.030 --> 04:41.550
So it's going to go ahead and then get to the start and ending inclusive like that.

04:41.550 --> 04:42.750
So it doesn't matter.

04:42.780 --> 04:43.680
Either way would work.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.040
I could just comment this out and then not pass anything.

04:47.640 --> 04:54.060
And what you can do, of course, is whenever we call bill form for a range, you can just go ahead

04:54.060 --> 04:58.590
and pass that or different numbers, whatever range you want.

04:59.130 --> 05:04.020
So this modifier here that we're passing also that will be used, it's being used here.

05:04.020 --> 05:07.230
So I can just change that to pass a modifier that way.

05:07.650 --> 05:13.380
If for some reason or whenever we call bill form, we know we always going to use this modifier, it's

05:13.380 --> 05:14.700
passed if nothing is passed.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.350
Of course, it's just going to pass a default modifier.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.250
So now we've tried it.

05:19.260 --> 05:24.660
So now we're trying to customize even further the way everything is created.

05:24.660 --> 05:29.800
So I'm going to pass a modifier again that we're passing along in our parameters or in this case, I

05:30.090 --> 05:30.510
should say.

05:34.830 --> 05:39.780
Pass it modifier there, so anywhere that it's needed, you can just pass that modifier.

05:40.860 --> 05:41.220
OK.

05:41.580 --> 05:42.360
And there you have it.

05:42.990 --> 05:46.530
Let's go ahead and run it once again just to make sure we didn't break anything.

05:50.500 --> 05:59.560
OK, there it is, let's put about 1000 nice numbers so we can see, OK, that's working still.

06:00.690 --> 06:07.080
He'll go ahead and say 50 percent, that's $500 each person.

06:08.250 --> 06:08.510
OK.

06:08.850 --> 06:11.300
We said there were only two people.

06:11.340 --> 06:17.340
There's one person, of course, going to be $500 and tip if the tip is 500, which means 50 percent

06:17.340 --> 06:19.140
of the bill amount.

06:20.100 --> 06:20.400
All right.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.140
So everything is working great.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.150
So we've done a lot of work here.

06:24.210 --> 06:32.790
And most importantly, we were able to hoist some of the states from bill form to its calling function.

06:33.270 --> 06:34.260
Composable function there.

06:34.910 --> 06:35.160
OK.

06:35.230 --> 06:36.900
Not all of them, but at least some of them.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.160
OK, very good.

06:38.310 --> 06:43.470
Ladies and gentlemen, what I would like you to do, of course, is to go and maybe practice by creating

06:43.620 --> 06:47.880
different, different calculators so you can go online and look for other calculators.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.450
Or maybe there is a calculator that we would like you always wanted to create.

06:51.990 --> 06:54.980
Now you've learned at least how to put together a user interface.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.640
You learn how to use state.

06:56.970 --> 07:03.240
He learned how to really put together all of these little pieces and make your application work dynamically,

07:03.240 --> 07:04.050
as you can see here.

07:04.290 --> 07:12.060
So and one thing to notice is that we are driving the entire calculations solely through the inputs

07:12.060 --> 07:19.110
that we're getting the data, the input that we adding into the app through the widgets, right through

07:19.410 --> 07:20.700
the composable functions.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.280
This is huge.

07:22.320 --> 07:28.500
So I don't have a button that allows me to add the value and then set everything up and then click Calculate

07:28.680 --> 07:31.740
which you could do, but you can see how easy it is.

07:31.890 --> 07:38.580
We are dependent on the state of the data so that then we pass the data and there are some sort of reactive

07:39.120 --> 07:44.580
component to to the functions that are receiving this on function functions that receive the data and

07:44.580 --> 07:48.180
they know how to rebuild himself so that they can display the correct data.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.110
OK.

07:49.170 --> 07:49.950
This is real good.

07:50.220 --> 07:50.610
OK.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.870
Congratulations.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.880
And I'll see you next.

00:00.510 --> 00:02.920
I hope you were able to go through that little exercise.

00:03.040 --> 00:03.850
It's so simple.

00:03.920 --> 00:04.500
You have it over.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.700
Of course, we can modify, use, modify the color thickness.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.950
I will like to look at the thickness because I think that's very interesting.

00:11.370 --> 00:15.030
I say thickness such and let's say one to 12 feet deep.

00:15.150 --> 00:16.860
I see why that's going to do fresh.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.780
And as you see, well, it's very thick.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.910
In some cases you may want that.

00:20.910 --> 00:22.680
But and not the case is you may not want that.

00:23.460 --> 00:28.010
Let's go ahead and go get rid of fat or just coming that out.

00:28.020 --> 00:33.750
And the next one I would like to add to look at, perhaps is the color we see thickness or start indent.

00:33.870 --> 00:35.320
What what's that all about?

00:35.360 --> 00:41.130
Let's they start indent, and I'm going to be exaggerating one three dpi.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.990
See what's going to happen if it's good, always good exercise or a good thing to try things out if

00:45.990 --> 00:48.930
you don't understand them, just to see what's the worst, that could happen.

00:49.230 --> 00:50.550
And as you can see there.

00:50.580 --> 00:53.550
OK, so now we know what our indent means.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.360
It makes sense.

00:54.360 --> 00:59.040
That means it will indent, or it will offset this line to the amount that we added there.

00:59.040 --> 01:04.980
So we can see now it's all the way to the right because 123 units, dpi units, to the right.

01:05.400 --> 01:05.700
All right.

01:05.710 --> 01:06.890
That was the little challenge.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.670
I don't wanting you to do, and I'm sure you played with the modifiers and you've seen how we use modifiers.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.240
OK, so I'm going to guess get rid of all of this and go back to what we had before, which is going

01:18.240 --> 01:21.180
to be just a default divider.

01:21.540 --> 01:21.830
OK.

01:22.290 --> 01:22.560
All right.

01:22.560 --> 01:30.240
So before we go to next VIDEO Also, there's another challenge I would like you to actually add a text

01:30.630 --> 01:32.640
that says Miles p like this.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.400
I would like you to also change the color of that text and make sure it is centered like this.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.220
Go ahead and see if he can do this.

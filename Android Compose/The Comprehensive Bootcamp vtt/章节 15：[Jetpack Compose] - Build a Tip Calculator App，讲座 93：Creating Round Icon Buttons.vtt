WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:08.530
OK, so continuing here, still, instead of a bill form, we can continue putting together the other

00:08.530 --> 00:10.170
part of the user interface, right?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.830
You put all of these other things here.

00:11.980 --> 00:20.200
So but the main idea really is that we want to make sure that all of this is shown if this value or

00:20.200 --> 00:26.920
if there's something right inside of our interview field, that's why we also have that's why we have

00:26.920 --> 00:35.110
this is valid or valid state, which is being used right here to retain whatever the keyboard functions

00:35.110 --> 00:36.100
we have at this point.

00:36.700 --> 00:37.540
If it's not valid.

00:39.010 --> 00:41.770
So we can use that as well to our advantage.

00:42.310 --> 00:47.980
So if you click in our field here, let me put this in the no line field and all this ends here.

00:48.460 --> 00:55.660
What it can do, I can also say something like this here and say, if valid, state that value.

00:56.840 --> 01:01.810
Well, actually, this fairly say that's fine, if you state.

01:04.250 --> 01:11.840
Then we're going to show all of this, which we haven't created yet, else we're just going to go ahead

01:11.840 --> 01:13.330
and show a box.

01:15.110 --> 01:16.490
Very sad, empty box.

01:18.040 --> 01:23.650
So here is just for experimenting, we say text and add a valid.

01:25.290 --> 01:26.160
Let's go ahead and run.

01:29.250 --> 01:35.830
You can see nothing it's showing there, right, because we have entered there's nothing, so it's invalid,

01:35.840 --> 01:37.010
that's why it's hidden.

01:37.010 --> 01:38.900
We just have a box empty box.

01:39.500 --> 01:44.630
But if I add 12 valid is showing, all right.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.150
There we go.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.190
That's that's very helpful.

01:46.370 --> 01:47.360
That's exactly what we want.

01:47.870 --> 01:51.650
Obviously, we want to add more than just the text that says, file it right.

01:51.950 --> 01:53.930
That's why we put all these things together.

01:54.350 --> 01:55.620
So what is that we're going to add here?

01:55.640 --> 02:00.020
Well, we want to add a lot of things, but first, let's go ahead and put a row.

02:01.280 --> 02:08.480
They say row, because I see here that I have this structure here that contains split and then we have

02:08.480 --> 02:10.670
button, then text and then another button.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.290
So this will be a row.

02:13.310 --> 02:14.720
So I'm going to go ahead and add a row.

02:15.860 --> 02:23.300
Let's go ahead and pass a modifier real quick here, padding overall padding here of about three dpi.

02:24.590 --> 02:30.190
And then let's look at horizontal arrangement of the same arrangement.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.550
I want this to be from the start, right?

02:33.570 --> 02:34.630
So everything's going to be.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.180
Let's see.

02:39.730 --> 02:42.190
Start like this, everything is going to be, too.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.870
They left, they start right then.

02:46.890 --> 02:54.990
I'm going to add a text that says, split in wrong here, I'm going to modify this text as well.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.160
So that's a modifier.

02:58.720 --> 03:10.320
A modifier as such, and then I can use a line or a line is another way for us to align the current

03:10.680 --> 03:11.410
function here.

03:11.430 --> 03:12.750
The current tax in this case?

03:13.180 --> 03:13.410
Right.

03:14.130 --> 03:15.120
So what I want to happen?

03:15.150 --> 03:17.760
Well, I want alignment of this text.

03:18.060 --> 03:20.640
Let's say alignment, right?

03:21.420 --> 03:22.970
Android compose there.

03:23.010 --> 03:27.660
There, I'm going to make it to make it to be center vertically.

03:29.280 --> 03:29.640
OK.

03:33.180 --> 03:40.740
And then next, I'm going to put a spacer and then I'm going to give and modify and it's a modifier.

03:44.350 --> 03:49.560
That width of about 120 deep.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.910
So what are we doing here is that I'm creating this text.

03:52.180 --> 03:56.470
And then because I know I'm inside of a row, I want this text.

03:57.890 --> 04:05.780
Because I know I'm inside of row, that means then I will need some spacing between the split and whatever

04:05.780 --> 04:11.660
else I'm going to add, which is going to be this section of buttons, some adding that space to the

04:11.660 --> 04:11.960
right.

04:13.690 --> 04:19.010
Because it's invalid state and that they see nothing happens, there was a 23 and well, I can see a

04:19.040 --> 04:20.710
split and things are good.

04:20.950 --> 04:25.840
The other thing I notice is that our Enter Bill text field here doesn't take the entire space and sat

04:25.840 --> 04:26.320
in the middle.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.130
So let's check where this is all being called.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.000
We have this column here, right?

04:34.030 --> 04:38.800
This column is enclosing the text field, so let's change a few things in this column.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.980
So we have it all work.

04:43.490 --> 04:44.180
The way we want.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.820
So let's add a modifier here.

04:49.720 --> 04:58.150
The power of modifiers, as you see now and the skipper padding all about 60p.

04:59.020 --> 05:06.730
And also, let's align things around a vertical alignment arrangement, I should say, and I want this

05:06.730 --> 05:09.010
to be the top.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.090
OK.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.890
Everything inside of his column.

05:12.370 --> 05:17.590
And then I'm going to put horizontal alignment when, say, alignments?

05:18.190 --> 05:19.750
We want to start.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.270
OK, let's go ahead and run real quick.

05:23.110 --> 05:24.240
OK, that's not bad.

05:24.310 --> 05:27.100
And later, we'll deal with the sizes and everything Regulus we see.

05:27.100 --> 05:27.850
Everything is good.

05:28.630 --> 05:31.180
You notice here the next thing we have, we have split.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.410
It's showing there, but we want to also have this structure here.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.870
So again, there's different ways to do this.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.380
What I'm going to do because I know it's going to be a row, right?

05:41.430 --> 05:43.390
These are side by side horizontally.

05:43.780 --> 05:46.720
So I'm going to create this structure inside of a row.

05:47.050 --> 05:50.440
So I'm going to create all of these buttons in this text inside of a row.

05:50.740 --> 05:52.600
So it's going to be a row inside of a row.

05:52.630 --> 05:53.360
That's totally fine.

05:53.380 --> 05:58.000
So after our space are there, I'm going to create another row passing the modifier.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.220
Modifiers such.

06:10.230 --> 06:11.580
Padding all.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.220
So for the padding here, I'm going to be strategic.

06:17.210 --> 06:24.770
So I'm just going to add the horizontal padding to the horizontal, and I want to see three dpi instead

06:24.770 --> 06:29.660
of all this two and a horizontal padding, so it's going to be left to right.

06:30.170 --> 06:30.440
OK.

06:33.200 --> 06:39.410
And the next thing I'm going to do also, it's still inside of our row.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.960
I'm going to say horizontal.

06:43.390 --> 06:45.190
Arrangement, I say arrangement.

06:45.220 --> 06:50.830
I want this to be to the end, because all of this is going to be to the end of the structure of this

06:50.830 --> 06:51.100
row.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.010
Right.

06:52.030 --> 06:53.110
Whatever, it's inside there.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.720
OK, so inside here, this is where then I'm going to add these buttons in this text now because we

07:01.720 --> 07:02.590
have two buttons here.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.290
If we think about it, that means that they're were very similar.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.470
The only difference is that this button here is minus.

07:08.770 --> 07:09.730
This is plus.

07:10.660 --> 07:14.920
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to create a structure that resembles this.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.330
If you think back, you remember that we can create anything that is clickable, right?

07:19.630 --> 07:24.640
There are buttons, actually buttons that we can use directly and we can change those.

07:24.820 --> 07:32.410
But we are going to modify just a circle and make it a button and add plus or minus and so forth.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.910
So we're going to create this structure.

07:34.300 --> 07:40.570
So to make this even better, I'm going to create a new file actually when to create a new package inside

07:40.570 --> 07:41.640
of the main package.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.850
Call this widget's.

07:45.100 --> 07:51.880
This is good so that we can divide things up, we can separate classes that do so, we can separate

07:51.880 --> 07:53.560
similar classes into one place.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.350
So we just we just going to add all the widgets.

07:57.700 --> 08:01.300
So instead of a widget here, we can add all the functions that present a widget.

08:01.570 --> 08:07.000
OK, so I'm going to right click again, create a cuddling class and just a file.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.720
That's fine.

08:08.230 --> 08:13.550
And this one, I'm going to call round icon button or such enter.

08:13.570 --> 08:14.200
And there we go.

08:14.650 --> 08:16.720
So these is what are we going to call inside here?

08:16.750 --> 08:22.000
So now when I come here, get rid of everything else that does not need to be there.

08:22.420 --> 08:22.750
All right.

08:22.750 --> 08:30.130
So here I'm going to create a composable function as such, and I'm going to say fun round

08:32.770 --> 08:36.310
round round icon button as such.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.360
And we're going to pass a few things right to create this pattern.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.830
A few parameters here.

08:42.700 --> 08:49.120
So the first one is going to be image vector because we need some sort of vector image here.

08:49.120 --> 08:56.860
Since the image vector is a type and which compose you are, graphics could be an icon.

08:56.860 --> 08:58.780
Could it be even be our own image?

08:59.770 --> 09:05.980
And then I'm going to obviously have on click event click method function here that we're going to be

09:05.980 --> 09:07.510
call or pass.

09:08.290 --> 09:12.880
You don't have to pass any parameters there, and it's going to be unit.

09:14.470 --> 09:23.710
I'm going to pass a modifier, and it's always customary to have modifiers as the first parameters we

09:23.710 --> 09:24.070
pass.

09:24.070 --> 09:24.790
So it's followed.

09:24.790 --> 09:28.600
That convention doesn't really matter, but I think it's better that way.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.390
And in this case, I'm going to pass a tent.

09:31.990 --> 09:42.760
Also, when I say color and I'm going to put a value or add a default value here and say color dot black.

09:43.980 --> 09:49.710
And I'm going to actually convert customize this to say Alpha pass in alpha.

09:49.740 --> 09:57.480
So how deemed how visible the color is to I said this to zero point eight.

09:58.320 --> 09:58.550
OK.

10:00.210 --> 10:00.690
There we go.

10:03.030 --> 10:06.320
And then I'm going to add the background color.

10:07.050 --> 10:11.160
This case also is going to be a color, but I'm going to pass a default one.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.630
I'm just going to use material theme.

10:15.810 --> 10:20.640
Scholars not on background color again, this is going to be more apparent later.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.020
Why are we using material?

10:22.020 --> 10:28.710
Theme on background color is because if we were changing our device, for instance, it is on dark mode,

10:28.710 --> 10:35.490
then the background is going to adapt to that mode without making everything look terrible.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.320
OK, let's also pass elevation variable here.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.020
It's going to be a DPI type.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.310
And as a default, I'm going to pass a four dot dpi.

10:48.540 --> 10:49.360
That's important.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.000
What do we need to import in this case?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.190
Is dpi density independent?

10:53.910 --> 10:54.360
There.

10:57.410 --> 11:01.970
So deep is an Android, you know, this stands for density independent pixel.

11:02.150 --> 11:05.780
So what he does is that he is independent of the device.

11:05.780 --> 11:14.870
So if I say for DP, if this app is running on a larger device, so the Android system, the Android

11:14.870 --> 11:20.930
compiler will be able to pick that and adapt to the pixels of that device.

11:21.500 --> 11:21.800
OK.

11:22.370 --> 11:23.000
That's what it is.

11:23.480 --> 11:23.840
All right.

11:24.170 --> 11:29.180
So again, all we're doing here was just passing all of these parameters so that we can customize our

11:29.330 --> 11:30.410
round icon button.

11:31.280 --> 11:36.110
And if you look at this, we've seen this many times all the composable, even the composable that happen

11:36.260 --> 11:42.790
to even the composable that we get from the framework from this toolkit, I should say the co-composed

11:42.800 --> 11:45.720
tool kit, they follow the same idea.

11:45.770 --> 11:46.730
That's the beauty here.

11:47.240 --> 11:47.640
All right.

11:47.660 --> 11:51.710
So what is that I want to show inside of these around I can button.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.230
Well, first I'm going to add a card.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.530
OK, so composable there.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.480
What's new?

11:59.960 --> 12:05.420
And then I'm going to pass it modifier and for the modifier and then see modifier that we're passing.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.020
OK?

12:06.560 --> 12:11.920
And say that padding all and say all again.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.090
Let's see, it looks like something is now right?

12:16.570 --> 12:19.810
Did I not get the right padding modifier?

12:20.650 --> 12:21.220
I can.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.660
This happens all the time.

12:22.780 --> 12:26.350
It's very important that we get the correct modifier, so get rid of that.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.420
And we can't import it.

12:28.420 --> 12:34.210
So alt or option enter and we need to get the Android X compose UI.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.370
OK, that's that's very crucial.

12:36.730 --> 12:40.090
Otherwise, you get the problems that you saw me getting.

12:40.540 --> 12:40.810
All right.

12:40.810 --> 12:44.230
So now I can say modify modifier padding and passing all here.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.090
I want for deep.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.210
And most importantly, I want to make this clickable.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.510
So I say clickable, so clickable here.

12:53.510 --> 13:02.210
Instead of going to the lambda, I'm actually going to pass as a parameter here on click right a function.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.920
I'm going to pass the function that I have.

13:04.250 --> 13:13.640
Now, if I had chosen to just use the lambda function or lambda trailing lambda here, I could still

13:13.640 --> 13:18.830
say, but I would have to say something like this click or click that invoke.

13:19.810 --> 13:26.620
OK, so this will just go ahead and invoke this on click whatever we pass there for them to finish like

13:26.620 --> 13:27.760
this, OK?

13:27.850 --> 13:28.780
Either way, works.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.850
Now the other thing we want to do.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.880
We can actually change our or concatenate this modifier with another.

13:37.570 --> 13:42.730
What that means is so I want to be able to make it so that when the button or in this kind of the card,

13:43.480 --> 13:45.910
which is going to be something like this, we'll get to that.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.330
When that's clicked, we want to change the behavior as well.

13:49.690 --> 13:56.670
So what I'm going to do after a clickable here, it's end white about there, right about there.

13:56.680 --> 14:02.470
So what I'm going to say and when I say that, then when that happens, I can't pass another modifier

14:02.470 --> 14:02.980
to it.

14:03.580 --> 14:04.790
What modifier I want to pass?

14:04.930 --> 14:06.550
Well, I want something to happen.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.610
I want to just say an icon.

14:11.380 --> 14:18.610
Button size modifier, which we haven't created, so let's go ahead and create that at the top here.

14:19.090 --> 14:27.760
So I'm going to create another file here, and it's going to be a modifier that padding actually size

14:28.660 --> 14:31.210
and it would have has 40+ dpi.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.970
Let's go ahead and import that.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.290
What are we doing here?

14:35.470 --> 14:39.160
Who's saying, OK, the moment this is clickable, we're going to attach yet another.

14:39.160 --> 14:43.150
If you have over this, then it says, concatenate this modifier with another.

14:43.450 --> 14:48.030
So it's going to return a modifier representing this modified followed by other in sequence.

14:49.540 --> 14:55.930
So when this is clicked, we're going to change the size a little bit, so to get that sort of animation

14:56.200 --> 14:58.000
that they can see that this has been clicked.

14:58.120 --> 14:58.990
Very nice trick.

14:59.110 --> 14:59.860
Let's continue.

15:00.430 --> 15:00.700
All right.

15:00.700 --> 15:05.980
So stealing our card here, if we were to take a look at this, it wouldn't look that great because

15:06.250 --> 15:09.640
we don't have this circle circular shape that we want.

15:09.880 --> 15:10.660
We can change that.

15:11.020 --> 15:17.620
So after this modifier, we've added, I can go ahead and say shape and pass the shape.

15:17.740 --> 15:21.160
Just going to say circle a shape and call it good.

15:21.350 --> 15:22.810
I have to go any further.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.480
And then I'm going to put in background color.

15:26.140 --> 15:31.510
In this case, I'm going to see background color, so I'm passing whatever, whatever.

15:31.510 --> 15:35.620
It's going to be passed as an argument here if nothing is passed to us as an argument.

15:35.860 --> 15:39.550
We're just going to get the on background for my two from material theme.

15:40.860 --> 15:41.180
All right.

15:41.730 --> 15:44.070
Let's go ahead and put elevation here.

15:44.430 --> 15:48.120
I'm going to just put the elevation that we're getting from our parameters.

15:48.150 --> 15:48.810
Let's see.

15:49.970 --> 15:50.890
Elevation.

15:51.210 --> 15:51.720
There we go.

15:52.530 --> 15:55.950
And inside of this card here, I'm going to add an icon.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.730
Right, because I want an icon, something minus or plus.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.220
So what how do we get our icon?

16:03.250 --> 16:06.760
Well, I'm going to say Icon invoked the icon image vector.

16:06.760 --> 16:07.630
That's the one we want.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.900
And in this case, I'm going to pass our icon.

16:12.150 --> 16:14.820
In fact, what we called we call this image vector.

16:14.970 --> 16:21.060
OK, I'm just going to pass that image vector, we're passing there in description, I'm going to say.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.010
Plus or minus?

16:27.160 --> 16:27.700
Icon.

16:30.680 --> 16:30.980
OK.

16:31.610 --> 16:39.080
And the beauty also is that for our icon, we can pass another property parameter here called tint.

16:40.040 --> 16:40.880
So it's a color.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.960
Essentially, I'm going to pass the color that we wanted to show.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.250
So this tint we created there.

16:49.160 --> 16:49.940
So it looks like.

16:51.370 --> 16:53.800
Let's rename this to elevation.

16:56.200 --> 16:56.460
There.

16:57.790 --> 16:58.120
All right.

16:58.960 --> 16:59.320
Oops.

17:02.450 --> 17:03.440
That's the name again.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.870
When elevation.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.930
OK, let's just say continue.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.820
OK, let's go see elevation again and pass.

17:14.920 --> 17:19.450
Elevation like this, and we should be good.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.680
Never mind, this is not supposed to be here.

17:23.890 --> 17:24.520
Let's see.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.790
And looks like something is not.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.520
This is tent.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.640
Something broke.

17:35.690 --> 17:36.510
OK, there we go.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.990
I think I made a little mistake, but it's all fixed now.

17:39.950 --> 17:46.130
OK, so now that we have this separate button here, we can call it anywhere we want.

17:46.460 --> 17:51.830
In fact, if I come here, if I call, say, round.

17:55.070 --> 18:00.350
Icon button as such, then it requires me to pass a few.

18:02.310 --> 18:05.880
As you see here, so for modifier, it can say modifier.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.580
So in this case here, I don't want to pass my fire.

18:11.030 --> 18:17.330
I can do that because the because the default is going to be passed, but an image icon, it's very

18:17.330 --> 18:21.170
important someone say icons again, go to default.

18:21.410 --> 18:21.970
Look at this.

18:21.980 --> 18:26.120
All of this is provided for us when I say remove white.

18:29.330 --> 18:29.860
Like this.

18:31.090 --> 18:37.300
And for the to do, let's go back to around icon just to make sure I yes, I need to pass.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.580
Let's just put a modifier.

18:42.560 --> 18:46.080
Like this so that we don't need that force to pass that modifier.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.020
OK, now there we go, much better.

18:48.440 --> 18:48.810
All right.

18:48.830 --> 18:54.260
And so now I can remove, I can go ahead and create another one.

18:55.940 --> 19:01.010
Just close like this, and I'm going to say add, right?

19:01.040 --> 19:03.920
So it's going to be add and remove its import.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.980
Take this now, if I run this, if all goes well.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.870
OK, so we have to add something.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.020
And you can see we have split.

19:14.230 --> 19:19.540
I have these nice looking buttons here.

19:19.550 --> 19:20.470
They don't look that great.

19:20.860 --> 19:21.860
OK, what's going on?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.860
Let's go back to our code.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.160
Let's go back to.

19:27.820 --> 19:35.020
On background, tint colour black are the problem here, says I said on background.

19:35.050 --> 19:41.050
What I want is just say background because on background will give that black colour, which we don't

19:41.050 --> 19:41.520
want this.

19:41.550 --> 19:42.640
Find this one more time.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.340
OK, let's add the valid number.

19:45.340 --> 19:45.850
And voila!

19:46.360 --> 19:50.470
I can see now we have this very nice buttons, and I apologize.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.610
The quality of my screen here.

19:53.620 --> 20:01.510
The reason why is because I'm running my phone and I have this mirroring visor software that allows

20:01.510 --> 20:03.010
me to mirror my phone.

20:03.010 --> 20:06.940
But the qualities that I create on your and it should be seeing something better.

20:06.940 --> 20:09.360
But as you see here, it's working.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.450
The buttons are there.

20:10.840 --> 20:11.920
They look like this.

20:13.350 --> 20:19.950
The beauty here you've noticed is that this round icon button, we can use it anywhere we want, right?

20:20.370 --> 20:26.130
Because we realized that we needed more than one instead of repeating the code, we put all of that

20:26.130 --> 20:30.960
into its one composable and then we made a composable passing parameter.

20:30.960 --> 20:36.320
So we made it more customizable which era, which allows us to go back and use it wherever we want.

20:36.330 --> 20:41.310
As you see here, I just call the same round icon button and change just the icons.

20:41.790 --> 20:42.360
And voila!

20:42.720 --> 20:46.410
And here, of course, on Click, I can put whatever I want to happen.

20:46.410 --> 20:50.370
When this button is clicked, I can say loudly and pass.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.640
So here you can see that I have.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.180
So now we have this on click buttons, I can say something like this.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.920
Logged, just so we see it removed.

21:02.460 --> 21:06.180
I'm sorry, I can't, for instance, I can copy all of this.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.510
And there's, let's say, add.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.110
OK, let's go ahead and run.

21:16.100 --> 21:16.670
Test.

21:17.210 --> 21:21.950
There we go, say, man, minus let's go to LOLCat.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.360
And you can see removed, if I say.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.710
Plus, add so it's working perfectly, all right.

21:32.670 --> 21:37.650
So this is how you should think about creating these composable functions.

21:37.680 --> 21:37.980
All right.

21:37.980 --> 21:44.880
So this video is real long, but I hope you're able to follow along and see how I think about creating

21:45.090 --> 21:49.530
these composable functions so that then we can reuse the code.

21:50.190 --> 21:53.700
OK, so we still have some work to do, but we'll get there.

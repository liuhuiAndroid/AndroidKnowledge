00:00.210 --> 00:05.520
All right, so we're doing great, we have done a lot of work so far so we can safely say that we put

00:05.520 --> 00:10.260
together the the first three screens that are solid.

00:10.590 --> 00:16.530
We understand that the users can actually go from the beginning where you can see a splash screen and

00:16.530 --> 00:22.500
they're taken, of course, to the logging screen, where they can either log in or create an account.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.780
So we've done all of this gracefully.

00:24.930 --> 00:26.070
And we're so happy.

00:26.220 --> 00:33.720
So this section, we were able to even go further by adding the Firebase Auth to create authorization

00:33.720 --> 00:40.470
for users so we can log in users so we can create user accounts and were also able to bypass the log

00:40.470 --> 00:41.010
in screen.

00:41.010 --> 00:46.590
Because Ada is that when users come into our apps, if they already have an account they have logged

00:46.590 --> 00:50.850
in before, it makes no sense to always ask them to log in again.

00:50.910 --> 00:54.600
That is not a good user experience, so they're with Firebase.

00:54.600 --> 01:00.990
We can check to see if there is indeed a user already locked in or has already logged in into our app.

01:01.260 --> 01:07.140
And we can do that and check if that's the case, then we can send those users to the correct screen.

01:07.140 --> 01:08.790
So we bypassed all of that.

01:08.970 --> 01:09.210
OK?

01:09.690 --> 01:17.190
And of course, we were able to save an actual user into our faster database, which is a separate bucket,

01:17.190 --> 01:21.990
if you will, of data where we can actually create a database and add our users.

01:22.020 --> 01:28.740
And this will become more apparent later, because now this user can have other properties that we may

01:28.740 --> 01:33.870
want, such as the profession, last name, avatar, whatever else do we want?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.610
OK, so this is real good.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.810
That's what we've been doing and we finalize in this section.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.370
So what's next?

01:41.400 --> 01:44.880
Well, next, we're going to tackle the home screen now.

01:45.240 --> 01:51.090
I like to look at the home screen as pieces of composable, so I do type.

01:51.090 --> 01:55.980
You can see we should have that top bar there, which will contain, of course, different pieces of

01:55.980 --> 01:56.580
compose walls.

01:57.030 --> 02:03.360
And then at the bottom, we have another layer, another composable, which will contain a few composable

02:03.360 --> 02:08.520
say, all right, so have a text left and then we have some sort of an avatar and then the name.

02:09.330 --> 02:16.530
And then here is going to be the section where we are going to show a card that contains some information

02:16.530 --> 02:18.360
about the book and so forth.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.080
This is where all the books that we are reading are going to show.

02:22.570 --> 02:24.750
And then, of course, inside, that's what I'm saying.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.870
We have that card there in this section.

02:26.870 --> 02:31.140
In the bottom here, we have a few other things, mostly reputation in terms of the user interface.

02:31.140 --> 02:32.400
So we still have that card.

02:32.700 --> 02:37.240
But now there are some differences because here is where we're going to add all the books that they

02:37.260 --> 02:37.980
haven't been read.

02:37.980 --> 02:46.860
So we just have on our list of to do rather with books that we will be reading, reading lists and the

02:46.860 --> 02:48.960
right to the bottom right.

02:49.020 --> 02:55.200
You can see we have that plus sign or plus icon inside of a circle.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.940
That's a floating action button.

02:56.940 --> 03:04.170
That is what we're going to be able to click and take them to a screen where they can search for a book

03:04.170 --> 03:05.550
and add a book and so forth.

03:05.580 --> 03:11.760
So the main screen at the home screen here, there is a lot of moving parts and we're going to tackle

03:11.910 --> 03:15.610
each piece one by one and put it this whole thing together.

03:15.630 --> 03:20.730
So this is how you should think about an application, whatever you building, don't think as a whole.

03:20.940 --> 03:26.280
First, I obviously think as a whole first and then start cutting, breaking things down.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.220
So you have manageable pieces.

03:29.950 --> 03:33.180
OK, so that's what are we going to be doing next?

03:33.330 --> 03:35.040
We're going to tackle the home screen.

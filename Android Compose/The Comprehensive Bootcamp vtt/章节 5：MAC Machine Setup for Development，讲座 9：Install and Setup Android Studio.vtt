WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:06.300
All right, so we need to install Android Studio, which is the official I.D. to download Android applications.

00:06.630 --> 00:09.900
Go to Google and type Android Studio as such.

00:09.900 --> 00:15.660
And then I think the second hit or so should be where you should be going to download industry and then

00:15.660 --> 00:19.630
you find a HTTPS developer to come this one here.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.280
Click on that.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.590
And that should take us here, right?

00:22.830 --> 00:29.790
Once we are here, we can go around and read about Android Studio and all the great things that Android

00:29.790 --> 00:33.030
Studio provides to developers and so forth.

00:33.040 --> 00:33.810
So it's pretty.

00:34.470 --> 00:38.610
I think it's a good idea to take the time to read more about it in a studio, especially if you're getting

00:38.610 --> 00:40.380
serious about Android development.

00:40.980 --> 00:44.370
It's come up here and click Download Android Studio.

00:44.580 --> 00:51.150
Such and of course, we'll have to read some terms and conditions just to make sure we are on the same

00:51.150 --> 00:53.730
page with the Google, of course.

00:54.180 --> 00:57.480
And then at the bottom, we can say I've read everything.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.130
Now here we have two options.

00:59.130 --> 01:05.790
If you are a Mac with Apple chip, of course you've got to go ahead and click and install this option.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.510
Otherwise, if you have Intel chip, you go this option.

01:09.510 --> 01:12.870
I happened to be on Intel, so I'm going to click on Intel.

01:13.080 --> 01:18.120
If you don't know which Mac you are using, I would just do a quick search and look on your Mac to see

01:18.120 --> 01:19.440
if you have an Apple chip.

01:19.650 --> 01:19.950
OK.

01:20.040 --> 01:24.510
So I have an older Mac, so Intel chip, that's what will work for me.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.360
OK, so click and we'll start.

01:27.360 --> 01:33.190
The download process may take a little while, so just wait until that is done and we'll proceed.

01:33.540 --> 01:39.960
Once all it's downloaded, you can just double click OK, so all we have to do is just take this Android

01:40.080 --> 01:45.230
studio here and drop into applications such that we take a little bit, OK?

01:45.240 --> 01:48.330
After a few seconds, you'll see that we're all good.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.040
All is installed.

01:50.070 --> 01:52.320
So what do we need to do now on Mac?

01:52.380 --> 01:57.710
Of course, we can just see command space and start typing in Android Studio as such.

01:57.730 --> 02:02.100
Now you will see that I do have, of course, two Android Studio, another one here.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.390
Just ignore everything else.

02:03.720 --> 02:10.470
But the the reason why I have two is because I already had Android Studio, so I'm just really recording

02:10.470 --> 02:15.270
this so that you have the opportunity to see how to download inside studio.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.520
So I'm going to pick this one here, which is the one that we just created or we just installed it set

02:20.520 --> 02:20.690
up.

02:20.700 --> 02:26.010
So what do you need to do, of course, is to double click and it will start verifying everything and

02:26.010 --> 02:27.300
making sure all is good.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.590
So this should happen.

02:28.590 --> 02:34.290
Android Studio and I know from internet you want to make sure that we are aware that this could also

02:34.290 --> 02:37.290
be a malware, but we know that it's trusted.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.270
So I'm going to say open in a way.

02:39.690 --> 02:40.250
And there we go.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.450
So now it is starting Android Studio.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.400
At this point, it's called Arctic Fox.

02:44.730 --> 02:49.980
So before all of that, we actually go through this process of configuring things and or studio, and

02:49.980 --> 02:53.640
we just go through that process, just follow the screen.

02:53.670 --> 03:00.030
You can choose standard or custom, and you can select a UI theme if you want a dark or light.

03:00.360 --> 03:05.460
You can also then start verifying settings, so to install everything that you need in one side and

03:05.460 --> 03:08.010
then you can go ahead and back and start the project.

03:08.460 --> 03:08.760
OK.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.100
So this is my settings, of course.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.260
And of course, you can customize Android Studio to your liking and customize.

03:15.270 --> 03:19.400
I have the accessibility I.D. font larger.

03:19.410 --> 03:24.870
So that way you can actually see, as I code, the bigger font it since I'm recording this course is

03:24.870 --> 03:26.400
better for you to be able to see.

03:26.670 --> 03:31.530
OK, so you can change, of course, the edit editor font, the fonts and so forth.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.700
So a lot of things here.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.080
And you can also add plugins and can learn more about Android Studio and so forth.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.390
OK, so back to our project here.

03:39.390 --> 03:44.640
You can go ahead and just starting your project, so we're going to create a project and voila.

03:44.790 --> 03:47.130
So now we have an option to start a new project.

03:47.310 --> 03:51.330
So as you see here, we have different paths we can take.

03:51.690 --> 03:55.510
What we're interested in is the empty compose activity, right?

03:55.590 --> 03:56.700
It's all about compose.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.310
And next, I'm going to have to add a name.

03:59.580 --> 04:05.910
OK, so my first compose whatever name you want, the location, that's fine.

04:05.910 --> 04:10.530
And also the package name, whatever you have, you probably going to have the calm that example that

04:10.800 --> 04:17.460
my first composer will, my first compose or whichever name you added at the top here for your application

04:17.760 --> 04:18.300
doesn't matter.

04:18.630 --> 04:23.890
And make sure that the language is Scotland because that's what we need and minimalistic in this case.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.470
Twenty eight, that's totally fine.

04:25.830 --> 04:26.120
All right.

04:26.130 --> 04:31.230
I'm going to go out and say, finish, and I was going to go ahead and provision our new application,

04:31.230 --> 04:32.850
new project, I should say.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.680
And because this is the first time this may take a few minutes, so just be patient and wait.

04:37.920 --> 04:38.220
All right.

04:38.220 --> 04:43.200
So right away, you can see our assistant here, we can actually close that down.

04:43.620 --> 04:48.840
It tells us a little bit about Arctic Fox, OK, what it's all about and so forth.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.010
So take time to read.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.840
So you want to read that on the browser?

04:51.840 --> 04:53.550
You can do so by clicking here.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.450
So for now, I'm just going to close it down a little bit.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.290
So now is indexing.

04:58.350 --> 04:59.820
Gradle is working a backend.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.010
It may take a little bit.

05:01.490 --> 05:06.680
Again, keep in mind the colors that you see here or my editor may be different than yours because of

05:06.680 --> 05:10.730
my settings that I have transported from previous installs and so forth.

05:11.120 --> 05:15.920
So don't worry too much if it doesn't look exactly as mine, right?

05:15.920 --> 05:21.290
As long as the Android Studio itself looks how it looks out of the box, that's totally fine.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.910
So we're waiting for Gradle to finish its singing process.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.030
It may take a little bit again.

05:26.030 --> 05:30.680
Just relax and we'll wait until it's all done OK.

05:30.710 --> 05:32.270
Once all is done.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.180
Let's see.

05:33.180 --> 05:35.330
You can see we have a project created.

05:35.630 --> 05:38.870
Can I sort of toggle that this to have more space?

05:39.410 --> 05:46.170
And now I'm actually running to see if we can see some sort of a preview to the right here, right?

05:46.190 --> 05:47.270
Because we have code.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.190
This is compose code.

05:49.580 --> 05:54.410
Now Gradle at the bottom here you can see Gradle building and running and hopefully soon we can see

05:54.410 --> 05:55.100
something here.

05:55.340 --> 06:02.360
And while I think it's building, still rendering slowly, but after a few attempts, you can see there

06:02.360 --> 06:02.820
we go.

06:02.830 --> 06:07.620
Can click this button here to make it look bigger 100 percent or can make it even bigger.

06:07.640 --> 06:12.170
I can see we have a low world is showing in our COMPOSE preview.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.990
OK, so this is success, as you can see.

06:15.260 --> 06:15.710
So, OK.

06:16.010 --> 06:16.310
All right.

06:16.550 --> 06:20.780
So as you can see, you should have your Android studio set up at this point should all be good.

06:21.050 --> 06:26.300
And the other thing we would want to do, of course, is to create an emulator because we want to use

06:26.300 --> 06:28.080
that to test our apps.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.480
So it's very simple.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.530
What you need to do is go to the top here where it says avid manager.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.100
Click.

06:34.460 --> 06:38.570
And as you can see, for me, I do have a few virtual devices already.

06:38.870 --> 06:43.640
But in your case, if this is your first time you've ever installed Android Studio, you should see

06:43.640 --> 06:44.360
nothing here.

06:44.660 --> 06:49.790
OK, so what you need to do is click on create a virtual device such and pick whatever you want.

06:49.970 --> 06:50.260
OK.

06:50.570 --> 06:54.590
I would always recommend to pick something that has placed or icon.

06:54.590 --> 06:56.720
Here is a lot of dependencies.

06:56.720 --> 07:04.430
A lot of libraries that we may need in the future are part of the Play Store library, so it's just

07:04.430 --> 07:06.930
a good thing to be aware of.

07:06.950 --> 07:10.220
So I'm going to pick Pixel four or I can pick something else.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.770
But Pixel four is fine of, let's say, next.

07:13.290 --> 07:20.450
In this case, here for your case, you may not have are or CU, depending on which API level we want

07:20.660 --> 07:23.540
to attach this emulator with.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.940
You will have to download it, right?

07:25.950 --> 07:31.250
So in this case here, if our, for instance, shows download, you will have to click download so that

07:31.250 --> 07:32.860
that is downloaded internally.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.510
Then we are going to be able to create that image.

07:35.810 --> 07:38.450
To create that emulator in this case is fine.

07:38.450 --> 07:39.800
I have it downloaded already.

07:40.070 --> 07:46.430
I'm just going to say next and I can change the name here U1 or whatever you want because I'm changing

07:46.430 --> 07:51.500
this name because I already have Pixel four API 30 installed already.

07:51.680 --> 07:51.980
OK.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.130
And of course, I use automatic.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.420
It's usually the one that is selected.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.110
That's fine.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.520
And everything else should be fine.

07:59.540 --> 08:00.590
And what do you need to do then?

08:00.620 --> 08:01.440
Just say, finish.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.470
I'm not going to do that because I don't want to create a new one.

08:03.710 --> 08:08.570
But it should be good if they finish, will take a few moments to create your in your family.

08:08.660 --> 08:08.960
OK.

08:09.530 --> 08:13.850
Once you're done, then you will see that it will be shown here as well.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.260
All right, very good.

08:15.560 --> 08:20.810
And once you have that, it's very simple because it's going to show you here as one of the available

08:20.810 --> 08:21.350
devices.

08:21.740 --> 08:24.200
And so and then you can just go ahead and click Run.

08:24.770 --> 08:25.940
We'll take a few moments.

08:26.980 --> 08:27.970
OK, it was good, David.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.030
I think he wants us to pick one.

08:30.160 --> 08:30.580
OK.

08:31.030 --> 08:32.950
I'm just going to go ahead and pick that one.

08:33.610 --> 08:36.730
OK, now says here connecting to the emulator.

08:37.120 --> 08:37.990
Just get rid of here.

08:38.790 --> 08:39.820
OK, get out of there.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.080
And we'll take a few moments ago and get this rebooting and new emulator.

08:44.410 --> 08:48.840
It's the equivalent of starting in your phone, so it may take a little bit after a few moments.

08:48.860 --> 08:56.020
Can see that we have successfully installed our Compose Android app here into our emulator.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.370
OK, so this is really good.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.940
And of course, as you can see here, I have some issues, but that's fine.

09:00.940 --> 09:07.780
He just tells us there's a warning because this pixel to know that it's probably lower API level than

09:07.930 --> 09:08.860
it needs to be.

09:08.980 --> 09:15.310
So what happened is that it went and got the Pixel four API 30, which is the minimum API level that

09:15.310 --> 09:18.610
it's needed in order to run compose applications in this case.

09:18.650 --> 09:25.660
OK, so this is good, which is the API level set up to run this app so that it's all good because Android

09:25.660 --> 09:30.400
Studio is smart enough to go and pick up the correct emulator to run this app?

09:30.730 --> 09:33.460
OK, so there we go, which should be good at this point.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.750
Ready to go?

09:35.470 --> 09:35.800
All right.

09:36.460 --> 09:37.930
Well, let's get to it.

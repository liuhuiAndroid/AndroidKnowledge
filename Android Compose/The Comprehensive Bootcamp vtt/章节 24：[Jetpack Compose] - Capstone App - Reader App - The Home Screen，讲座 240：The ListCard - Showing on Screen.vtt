00:00.720 --> 00:07.230
All right, so let's go ahead and look at creating this structure here again, I'm going to create a

00:07.230 --> 00:17.850
different composable, but I make this preview of also preview as such and then act composable.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.750
This is a function I'm going to call this rounded.

00:28.180 --> 00:30.040
Button, because it is indeed a button.

00:30.430 --> 00:34.030
OK, OK, good call something else, but different button sounds better.

00:34.510 --> 00:34.780
All right.

00:34.780 --> 00:41.860
So I'm going to pass a label here because each one will need a label of a string.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.620
Let's close this, so we don't have distractions.

00:54.070 --> 01:02.680
And let's set it to reading for now, and then let's pass a radius.

01:04.510 --> 01:10.870
It's going to be an integer and let's set it to 29 as its default and we're going to need the UN press,

01:11.320 --> 01:11.700
OK?

01:12.430 --> 01:12.970
Press,

01:16.360 --> 01:19.950
let's just say passing empty there.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.950
It's going to be unit.

01:22.510 --> 01:22.900
All right.

01:23.110 --> 01:32.050
So inside here, I'm going to start by putting together a surface and less passive modifier modifier,

01:32.680 --> 01:37.600
and I'm going to go straight to clipping because I want to clip into a shape.

01:37.600 --> 01:45.010
So I'm going to pass this great pass a rounded, rounded corners shape, and I'm going to change a few

01:45.010 --> 01:48.490
things differently, depending on the side of the shape.

01:48.850 --> 01:53.380
Because you see here, this structure has this side's going to be like this and this is going to be

01:53.380 --> 01:54.850
different and the tops.

01:54.970 --> 01:59.890
So there's a lot of different rounding that I'm going to add to each side.

02:00.640 --> 02:09.250
OK, so bottom, so bottom and percentage, I'm going to pass the radius that we're passing and.

02:10.470 --> 02:11.610
Top start.

02:12.540 --> 02:20.430
It's also going to be the radius, so we're looking at the bottom and this is the bottom end and top

02:20.430 --> 02:21.840
start is going to be this.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.710
So these two will have the same percentages of roundness.

02:26.610 --> 02:28.710
OK, and let's go ahead and give you a color.

02:29.880 --> 02:35.550
I have a special color for it like this we've seen before and.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.030
That's good.

02:38.350 --> 02:46.280
Now we're going to go into the contents of its column like this and I'm going to pass modifier again.

02:49.180 --> 02:54.970
With in this case, I'm going to make it 90 deep, and then I'm going to say, oops.

02:55.450 --> 03:01.080
And then we say height in this is a different function.

03:01.130 --> 03:01.990
I'm going to call here.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.390
So let's go ahead and have a look and see what this is.

03:04.870 --> 03:08.110
Well, this is going to arrange things differently.

03:08.110 --> 03:14.950
So it's going to constrain the height of the content to be between Mendip and Max deep as permitted

03:14.950 --> 03:16.930
by incoming measurement.

03:17.140 --> 03:17.380
OK.

03:17.680 --> 03:24.550
So we are trying to make sure that the contents of this surface in this case of this one button will

03:24.550 --> 03:26.470
be constrained somehow.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.800
So the constraint we're going past is going to be about 40 dpi, depending on on the overall, depending

03:32.800 --> 03:36.310
on our surface and where this surface is being laid out.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.220
And then I'm going to make this clickable.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.920
In fact, we're not going to do anything.

03:45.220 --> 03:49.420
They make this clickable, I'm just going to say on press, OK, so there we go.

03:50.110 --> 03:52.120
All right, let's continue here.

03:52.540 --> 04:01.930
I want to make sure that the vertical arrangement is center and horizontal alignment here.

04:02.530 --> 04:04.450
It's going to be center horizontally.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.810
OK, so inside now I'm going to add a text.

04:09.010 --> 04:13.000
This text is going to have a label which is going to be passed along.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.850
And let's give a style, let's say, text style, different ways of styling thing.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.520
This is the beauty of compose, of course.

04:21.880 --> 04:32.560
So when I say color, just give it color that white and font size, let's give about 15 ACP.

04:36.890 --> 04:37.150
OK.

04:37.230 --> 04:37.820
And that's it.

04:38.750 --> 04:47.030
Now this round button, it's going to be called so right after our column, I'm just going to put another

04:47.030 --> 04:48.500
row right here.

04:49.720 --> 04:55.330
And it's a horizontal arrangement space.

04:57.030 --> 04:57.720
Between.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.470
And then vertical

05:07.170 --> 05:07.980
alignment.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.430
Bottom like this.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.380
But here, let's add a rounded button.

05:19.860 --> 05:30.780
Let's just pass a label, sure, that says Reading, and let's pass a radius of about 70.

05:31.810 --> 05:36.040
Like that, great, let's see if this is going to show something.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.090
OK, so there it is, but it's not necessarily where we want it to be.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.520
It's right at the top here.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.030
So this has to come down here.

05:46.420 --> 05:46.680
OK.

05:46.990 --> 05:51.430
So I think what I need to do is this has to still be inside of this column.

05:51.430 --> 05:55.760
So let's put inside of the column, they're fresh.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.610
We should probably have it down here, hopefully.

05:58.630 --> 05:59.020
Let's see.

06:02.870 --> 06:04.730
OK, that's good, that's good progress.

06:05.660 --> 06:09.890
We want this to be all the way to the right, but at least we know it's part of this column here, so

06:09.890 --> 06:10.670
it's looking really good.

06:11.090 --> 06:11.600
Very nice.

06:12.320 --> 06:19.610
This is the power of using compose because you cannot take a card, for instance, and clip to make

06:19.610 --> 06:21.080
it look the way you want it to look.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.240
OK, so this is good.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.630
Now we need to figure out a way to get this to the right.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.790
So what we can do because we have is inside of a row, we have space in between.

06:29.810 --> 06:36.320
In fact, let's see if we can say push that to end, right, so that whatever it is inside of a row

06:36.320 --> 06:38.360
is going to go to the end of the room.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.160
See if this is going to help.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.120
And while that works perfectly.

06:44.410 --> 06:48.010
Of course, it looks a little bit strange because we don't have that image there, but at least we have

06:48.310 --> 06:49.810
the infrastructure that we need.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.400
So back to our home.

06:51.670 --> 06:51.670
I.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.500
Let's close this down.

06:54.340 --> 06:57.580
Well, actually our home content, but this is what's called inside of our home.

06:58.330 --> 07:02.350
How about adding, Let's see, this is our role.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.810
Just this is our column.

07:05.050 --> 07:05.530
Very good.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.330
So how about here?

07:07.340 --> 07:09.430
I'm going to pass just real quick.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.350
Our list card?

07:11.740 --> 07:12.760
Let's go ahead and run.

07:13.580 --> 07:16.600
In fact, before we run was, see, that's going to show.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.090
Let's just go ahead and run real quick here.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.400
I think it would be better that way.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.980
We have this very nice card, says Reading.

07:26.250 --> 07:30.720
Look at that, and we have the ratings and heart, and the one thing that is missing is, of course,

07:30.720 --> 07:31.500
an image here.

07:31.830 --> 07:37.050
And we can change that later, but at least we see this structure is working.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.100
All right.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.090
It's looking really good.

07:39.450 --> 07:40.140
Very exciting.

07:40.650 --> 07:43.080
So once we have the image, then we should be golden.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.220
This is good.

07:44.790 --> 07:45.230
All right.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.250
It's coming together pretty nicely.

07:47.970 --> 07:48.870
Oh, it's exciting.

07:49.500 --> 07:56.010
Next, we'll continue working on finalizing our main screen here and hopefully attach an image here,

07:56.010 --> 07:58.230
a dummy image so we can see how it all works.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.290
OK, but so far you can even click on it.

08:01.710 --> 08:02.820
It's really good.

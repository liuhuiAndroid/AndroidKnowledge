00:01.560 --> 00:05.040
Now we're going to work on the logic, but we're going to start small.

00:05.100 --> 00:10.590
So we're going to start with this split, these two buttons here we have minus and plus.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.600
OK, so it is simple.

00:12.600 --> 00:18.900
We want to make sure that when we click minus in this case to subtract, we want to subtract a number

00:19.350 --> 00:20.880
and if we go upwards.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.120
Plus, we're going to add more people.

00:23.130 --> 00:28.740
In this case, where he was saying that we want to split three ways four ways five, six, seven, 10,

00:28.980 --> 00:29.970
10 ways and so forth.

00:30.390 --> 00:31.590
OK, let's look at that logic.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.530
And all of that is found inside of a round button.

00:34.530 --> 00:42.420
So if I go back to our bill form, we'll see that we have input there and we have a row.

00:43.350 --> 00:47.220
And let's start with our first button here, which is the minus button.

00:47.970 --> 00:51.180
So all of that is going to happen inside of our own click.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.610
So what is it that we want to happen?

00:53.820 --> 00:58.200
Remember that in this case here, we need to always think of this state.

00:58.200 --> 01:04.860
We want to keep this state or the counter in this case of the people or the amount or we are going to

01:04.860 --> 01:05.580
split by.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.960
So what do we need to do again?

01:07.980 --> 01:11.730
You may have guessed, wouldn't create yet another state at the top here.

01:12.690 --> 01:19.380
And this is going to be what I call the let's say Val say, split by.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.710
State, OK and say, remember?

01:26.250 --> 01:33.570
State of it's going to an integer just pass this pass one hour on click run button here, what is that?

01:33.570 --> 01:34.230
We want to happen.

01:34.500 --> 01:43.110
So we want to say split by the value, the state, that value in this case, we want to set it to a

01:43.110 --> 01:43.950
certain value.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.000
But when you think about this first, what do we want to happen?

01:48.270 --> 01:54.300
Is that this value here when we click, let's say, if we have, first of all, it always should have

01:54.300 --> 01:54.670
one.

01:54.690 --> 01:58.230
That's important because we don't want to split by zero.

01:58.350 --> 02:03.900
We need to put some sort of a range to say, OK, if we get to one as they click miners, we need to

02:03.900 --> 02:04.560
stop at one.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.330
So here I'm going to put an if statement.

02:06.450 --> 02:13.920
Let's put it in the near line with say if, if split by state that value current one that we may have

02:14.550 --> 02:16.020
is greater than one.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.250
Then in that case, then split by value.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.720
I'm just going to say minus one, so I'm going to subtract.

02:27.760 --> 02:34.090
Might be that would work else, I'm just going to say it's played by, it's going to be equal to one.

02:34.570 --> 02:41.710
So we're saying here the value of our split by state is going to be equal depending on whether to value,

02:41.710 --> 02:43.210
current value is greater than one.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.580
If it is greater than one, then yes, we're going to subtract minus one, because that means we haven't

02:48.580 --> 02:49.420
hit zero yet.

02:50.140 --> 02:57.520
Else, if it is indeed less than one right, then which is going to say this is going to be one, that's

02:57.520 --> 03:01.780
what we're going to pass inside here because this is just a dummy data, we added here.

03:01.790 --> 03:05.670
So I'm going to say split by that value as such.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.640
Let's see if this works.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.480
We'll go ahead and run.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.390
OK, so now we see one here.

03:10.390 --> 03:16.930
The reason being is because we said the first state of the first value, the default values are going

03:16.930 --> 03:20.170
to be one less actually changes to zero, which are very good.

03:20.590 --> 03:27.310
That means then if I try to go minus not, it's not going to happen if I change this just for testing

03:27.310 --> 03:27.940
purposes.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.870
If I say, for instance, three.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.090
Let's run again.

03:36.580 --> 03:43.780
Because of what we've just done here, the safe statement and checking the values, you will see that

03:43.780 --> 03:47.380
we are going to be able to subtract the value.

03:49.280 --> 03:55.160
So now is this three, if I go down right, there we go, but if I get one, try to keep going, it's

03:55.160 --> 03:56.600
not going to accept that value.

03:57.500 --> 03:57.830
Very good.

03:57.860 --> 03:58.970
That's exactly what we want.

03:59.420 --> 04:02.740
Let's go back and put one here.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.040
Here, there's really not much work to do.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.360
But just for fun.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.880
What we can do, we can put a cap, right?

04:11.450 --> 04:16.250
Let's say we want to make sure that they split by state that value.

04:16.250 --> 04:21.620
In this case, we'll check to see if it's less than a certain range.

04:21.980 --> 04:26.420
So I can use Cartland to calculate a range or to give us a range.

04:26.690 --> 04:33.260
Let's create here and say Val range, be equal to it.

04:34.900 --> 04:41.740
Range like this, and they can pass here, start, it's going to be one and and inclusive, let's say,

04:41.740 --> 04:43.610
100 just to be dramatic.

04:43.670 --> 04:49.570
OK, so now we can use that range to compare if split buying value is less than.

04:49.720 --> 04:57.160
And then I'm going to say split value or split by value, then I'm going to be able to say split by

04:57.160 --> 04:58.150
value again.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.310
Plus, one makes sense because we're within the range.

05:04.420 --> 05:07.360
So let's say value like this to get the actual value.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.370
OK, let's go ahead and run.

05:10.650 --> 05:11.350
OK, let's see.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.130
And it's working for go.

05:16.320 --> 05:20.700
Lower, we can see works stops at one end, very good.

05:20.910 --> 05:24.630
So our split buttons here are indeed working.

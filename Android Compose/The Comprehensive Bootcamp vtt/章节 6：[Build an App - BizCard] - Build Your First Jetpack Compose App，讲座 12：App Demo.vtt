00:00.420 --> 00:05.820
All right, so I know we are very excited and we want to get to it right, so before we move forward

00:05.880 --> 00:12.810
to do other things like, for instance, learning about Caitlin or go dive right into compose whichever

00:12.810 --> 00:13.800
path you choose.

00:13.830 --> 00:14.820
This is what we're going to be doing.

00:14.830 --> 00:17.340
We're going to build a simple app called Business Card.

00:17.790 --> 00:18.780
At Basic Card.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.420
It's essentially it's a very simple app.

00:20.430 --> 00:25.380
As I said, we will have, as you see there, a picture at the top and then we're going to have a name.

00:25.620 --> 00:29.720
And of course, the profession of this person of Twitter account handle.

00:29.730 --> 00:35.970
And of course, about once that portfolio button is clicked, we are going to show a list of their projects.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.600
Let me show you now the actual app working on them later.

00:39.690 --> 00:40.770
Before we start building it.

00:40.950 --> 00:44.070
So here is a little demo of what we are going to be building.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.010
It's very simple, like I said, but it will showcase the power of Android Jetpack compose.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.240
The app is running.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.500
As you can see here we have a profile picture and in the background, if you can see we can make this

00:55.500 --> 00:59.820
a little bit bigger, perhaps you to be able to see, you can see we have this very nice background

00:59.820 --> 01:04.380
rounded corners and you have a profile picture divider in your name.

01:04.440 --> 01:10.860
And of course, Android compose program or the title of this person and then their Twitter account handle

01:10.860 --> 01:11.180
there.

01:11.190 --> 01:12.300
And of course, the button.

01:12.600 --> 01:18.270
The beauty here is that the portfolio button when you click, it's going to show a list course of all

01:18.270 --> 01:19.630
of the project of this person.

01:19.650 --> 01:24.680
All of this Islamic data can see it's a list you can scroll up and down the click back.

01:24.690 --> 01:30.450
It's going to go ahead and of course, toggle the contents of our projects really nice.

01:30.570 --> 01:32.160
So this is what I'm going to be building.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.080
And we're going to have a lot of fun.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.310
Let's go ahead and get started.

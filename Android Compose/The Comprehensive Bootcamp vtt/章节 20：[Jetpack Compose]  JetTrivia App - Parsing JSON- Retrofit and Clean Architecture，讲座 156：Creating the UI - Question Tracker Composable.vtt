WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:06.190
So let's start putting together the user interface now that we know that we have data and it's time

00:06.190 --> 00:07.610
to put together be user interface.

00:07.630 --> 00:08.380
It just makes sense.

00:08.860 --> 00:10.750
All right, so this is what we going for.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.790
It's a simple user interface, really.

00:12.790 --> 00:17.080
As you see here, there really isn't that much going on, but yet we're going to go ahead and build

00:17.080 --> 00:17.230
it.

00:17.620 --> 00:17.890
OK.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.140
Let's start with the top section.

00:20.620 --> 00:21.850
So what I'm going to do?

00:21.880 --> 00:24.280
Let's go ahead and divide things up on one.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.430
Create another composable at the bottom here.

00:27.460 --> 00:30.940
So at, let's call this question.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.260
Display.

00:35.960 --> 00:45.470
I such finales make this at preview, so we can see the preview, this content Susquehanna split.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.050
And while so there's really nothing there yet.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.250
That's why it's empty.

00:52.330 --> 00:53.770
So what is there want to do here?

00:53.800 --> 00:57.760
First, let's create a surface that seems to be what we do first.

00:58.630 --> 01:00.820
So instead of a surface, I'm going to pass modifier.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.760
And I want to start with Phil.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.980
Max with.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.450
Such and then Phil Max height.

01:13.880 --> 01:19.520
And while I'm here, let's just give a general pattern of about five dpi or for dpi that is scoring

01:19.520 --> 01:21.890
important our DPI.

01:23.690 --> 01:24.040
OK.

01:24.230 --> 01:24.830
Very well.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.370
Let's go ahead and refresh us to see what's going on.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.260
All right, there we go.

01:30.890 --> 01:37.400
Nothing really out of this world, but at least we see we have something showing their next list ad.

01:37.820 --> 01:38.810
Let's give a color.

01:39.440 --> 01:46.190
And in this case, here, I'm actually going to create yet another class instead of a utils hardline

01:46.190 --> 01:46.610
class.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.140
This is going to be just an object.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.130
It's called this app colors.

01:53.970 --> 01:55.800
So what are we going to add here?

01:55.830 --> 01:59.670
Just some static colors for our app, so this will help.

01:59.670 --> 02:06.000
I'm just going to go ahead and get a few colors that I've created, so I don't have to type all of them

02:06.000 --> 02:07.690
and bore you with all these details.

02:07.710 --> 02:11.790
So we should have access to all of these, of course, in the GitHub to get all of these.

02:11.790 --> 02:12.900
So that's not a problem.

02:13.290 --> 02:19.350
So we have our app colors there and it's very good so we can now use it to invoke them inside here so

02:19.350 --> 02:20.250
we can get those colors.

02:20.880 --> 02:21.200
OK.

02:21.510 --> 02:32.250
So now I can say here app colors such and in this case, I'm going to get the M and dark purple like

02:32.250 --> 02:32.610
this.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.830
That's the color I'm going to have in the background.

02:34.830 --> 02:38.220
So trying to mimic this color you see in the background there.

02:40.670 --> 02:46.430
And now that we say, let's go ahead and refresh to see if that's going to change, it should.

02:47.270 --> 02:47.570
OK.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.410
Very nice.

02:49.670 --> 02:57.350
So inside we are going to create a column because all of the items are going to be laid out vertically

02:58.190 --> 02:58.540
somewhere.

02:58.550 --> 02:59.570
Passive modifier

03:02.930 --> 03:04.910
give her padding of 12 dpi.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.550
And then let's give it a vertical arrangement.

03:13.640 --> 03:21.050
I'm going to arrange top all of items to be at the top first and then horizontal arrangement or alignment,

03:21.050 --> 03:22.370
that is when a center.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.550
Actually, I want to start alignment to stars.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.410
It all starts from the left.

03:27.950 --> 03:28.280
All right.

03:28.510 --> 03:28.650
All right.

03:28.720 --> 03:28.970
Good.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.910
So next, we are going to add this.

03:33.420 --> 03:41.010
UI element here, I'm going to go ahead at the bottom, you create yet another composable such let's

03:41.010 --> 03:46.110
call this question tracker is going to track the question.

03:46.110 --> 03:50.160
As you see here, we're going to have zero out of 40 875 something like that.

03:52.620 --> 03:58.130
And I can go ahead and also add another preview here so we can take a look now.

03:58.140 --> 04:05.250
This tracker here will have, as you see here, the first numbers are going to be zero out of the entire

04:05.580 --> 04:07.140
size of our list.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.770
So I'm going to pass two parameters here.

04:10.780 --> 04:18.030
So counter it's going to be an inch and I'm just going to give it 10 to start with so we can see something.

04:19.860 --> 04:27.390
And then out of this call, it's going to be an inch and I'm just going to give a hundred as a default.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.160
OK, good.

04:29.610 --> 04:36.660
So here I'm going to add a text, not just any other text, and I'm going to add an annotated string

04:36.690 --> 04:38.760
text annotated string as such.

04:39.090 --> 04:45.410
This will allow us to divide or to change parts of our string or text, as you see here.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.960
So this one question zero.

04:47.250 --> 04:51.270
See its different size, then this next number there.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.630
So that's why we're going to use annotated string.

04:55.110 --> 05:01.050
So for that, you know, text here, I'm going to use the build annotated string of such suits at Lambda.

05:01.620 --> 05:05.400
So now inside here, I'm going to pass with style

05:08.040 --> 05:09.190
and I would say style.

05:09.190 --> 05:13.620
I'm going to pass style and I see paragraph style.

05:15.290 --> 05:23.290
Text inent for the first part and say text intent, none.

05:23.930 --> 05:34.010
So there is no invitation for this text, so I can't pass another with style here inside for a style

05:34.430 --> 05:40.100
parameter, I'm going to just say span style for the color.

05:40.310 --> 05:48.010
In this case, I want to see app colors again and say, Am light purple or gray, actually?

05:48.980 --> 05:49.250
OK.

05:50.420 --> 05:58.340
And then I'll continue, I'm going to say font weight, I want this to be a bold like this.

06:00.290 --> 06:08.030
And also a wonderful in size to be a little bit extravagance or 27 that speaks, so we need to use the

06:08.120 --> 06:12.530
Unit ESP when we are dealing with strings or text in this case.

06:12.770 --> 06:13.460
Not deep.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.870
That's the recommendation.

06:15.530 --> 06:15.930
All right.

06:15.980 --> 06:24.020
So now in this lambda here, I'm going to build the actual string that I want to annotate, which I

06:24.020 --> 06:26.420
want to pass all of these styles that we've created.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.170
So I'm going to say Append.

06:28.190 --> 06:31.310
So in this case, I'm going to be handed a text and I want this to be.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.440
So it's going to be your question.

06:35.180 --> 06:42.290
And then I'm going to pass the counter value right variable and for a slash like they.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.700
So it's going to be something like that.

06:44.660 --> 06:44.890
OK.

06:45.350 --> 06:49.520
Because I want annotated this different than this other text.

06:50.730 --> 06:50.950
Right.

06:51.100 --> 06:51.670
Very handy.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.070
A little bit of water back, very handy.

06:54.400 --> 06:59.950
OK, let's go ahead and refresh this to see if we can see to see our preview at the bottom here.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.250
All right.

07:02.470 --> 07:05.200
So you can see the bottom here.

07:07.100 --> 07:16.340
Concedes his question for now, I'm going to comment this out that we don't see this, OK, so we see

07:16.340 --> 07:17.360
that question.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.880
Ten out of something.

07:20.750 --> 07:26.050
So next, we're going to create this last session where there right?

07:26.480 --> 07:30.440
So right there and let's say with style, do the same thing.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.300
Expense style can pass the color.

07:38.220 --> 07:39.210
Light grey.

07:41.120 --> 07:48.200
That's what we had before and lost a font weight.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.520
I want light to differentiate.

07:58.930 --> 08:00.250
Font size.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.610
This is going to be smaller, 14 sb like that.

08:07.610 --> 08:11.750
And then, of course, what is that we want to append here for our text?

08:12.350 --> 08:21.290
It's going to be the out of variable, which should be out of not out of let's go ahead and refactor

08:21.290 --> 08:21.650
that.

08:25.990 --> 08:28.450
Out of right.

08:30.040 --> 08:30.400
Very good.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.420
So that looks real good.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.880
Question 10 out of 100.

08:34.900 --> 08:40.780
So still, instead of a tax here, if you click there, we noticed that are text parameters and here

08:40.930 --> 08:45.190
because we're passing this bill annotated annotated string there.

08:45.190 --> 08:48.850
So that means we can still pass other parameters in our text.

08:49.910 --> 08:50.210
Right.

08:50.390 --> 08:56.930
So when a pass modifier, our good friend and we say modifier, I want to give a padding in general

08:56.930 --> 08:59.600
patting of about 20 deep or such.

09:01.420 --> 09:01.680
OK.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.610
Very nice to we have that nice padding.

09:04.240 --> 09:11.170
All right, so now that we have our question tracker, we can of course call that inside there right

09:11.170 --> 09:11.710
about here.

09:11.710 --> 09:15.880
And I say a question tracker, such a personal nothing.

09:15.880 --> 09:16.930
For now, that's fine.

09:17.620 --> 09:23.920
And if we go up and to make sure that our preview is on.

09:25.590 --> 09:27.810
Should be able to see the full picture, hopefully.

09:28.410 --> 09:32.310
Angela looks real good question.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.500
Ten out of 100.

00:00.270 --> 00:04.410
I hope you were able to add the button here just below the miles compose.

00:04.770 --> 00:05.630
It's pretty simple.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.040
All you have to do is just say button such and you should have an option to create a button hit enter.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.060
And then there you have it.

00:12.420 --> 00:12.990
Very simple.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.230
One of the main parameters that is passing is don't click with.

00:16.230 --> 00:22.440
The idea is that a button needs to retrieve or needs to listen to an event and respond to that event.

00:22.740 --> 00:23.340
It makes sense.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.070
So that's why your click is right away, given that there is needed to do here, there's a code block

00:29.070 --> 00:30.330
here that needs to be filled.

00:30.540 --> 00:31.060
What is that?

00:31.060 --> 00:32.970
If we want to happen when the buttons click?

00:33.210 --> 00:38.460
First of all, as it is the button right now, notice it says button and then hers and click and there

00:38.460 --> 00:40.310
is the arrow scope.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.440
So this is where we are going to add the contents inside of these buttons.

00:44.480 --> 00:49.530
In this case, we're going to pass a text because we want to give this button label, say, text.

00:49.830 --> 00:52.830
This is going to be saying what is going to sit in its portfolio.

00:53.070 --> 00:57.150
And as always, we can all was pass other parameters.

00:57.540 --> 01:01.230
In this case, let's say style and style this button and simplify.

01:01.230 --> 01:07.830
I'm going to use material theme again, and I'm going to go to typography and button.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.750
So there is a typography for button when we talk about typography in general, trigger by the font,

01:13.050 --> 01:14.250
the types and so forth.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.260
So let's go ahead and refresh and see what will transpire from this.

01:19.770 --> 01:20.610
And there you have it.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.680
So you see there is a button.

01:23.010 --> 01:23.910
Let's go ahead and run this.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.490
You see on our emulator.

01:27.040 --> 01:27.670
And there you have it.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.440
Very nice.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.320
I'm going to make this a little bigger and close that down a little bit.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.100
OK.

01:32.580 --> 01:33.400
It's looking very good.

01:33.420 --> 01:36.150
There's a button, and all of this is given to us.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.060
So click.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.120
You can see there is that ripple effect.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.010
We didn't have to do anything, really.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.930
All of that is just there for us.

01:43.350 --> 01:46.050
So in this case, here, I'm going to show you on click so on, click.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.160
We want something to happen.

01:47.310 --> 01:51.840
But for now, I'm just going to see emoji log D like this.

01:52.080 --> 01:58.500
And if you see that just hit enter, this is going to allow us to log a few message into our debug console.

01:58.920 --> 02:04.320
So I'm just going to say here clicked and I'm going to change this to clicked like that.

02:04.830 --> 02:06.120
This is the tag.

02:06.450 --> 02:07.770
And now I'm going to go down here.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.110
Open now, Logcat.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.860
This is why we're going to see all of the messages coming from our app.

02:11.880 --> 02:17.550
I'm going to change this to debug because this is d for debug unless we run this.

02:17.910 --> 02:18.180
OK?

02:18.920 --> 02:19.280
OK.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.610
So of smaller.

02:20.970 --> 02:26.340
So now if I click can see clicked with this card clicked.

02:26.610 --> 02:29.430
Now we know when we click the button, something happens.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.490
In this case, we just logging out this message to the console.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.210
Great.

02:33.300 --> 02:39.870
So we made a lot of progress here, and I hope you're still seeing how things work, at least at a very

02:39.870 --> 02:40.390
high level.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.260
And I have to remind you again that I don't want you to get too worried.

02:43.500 --> 02:49.200
This is just to get you started real quick to see this little bit of what's possible with compose and

02:49.200 --> 02:51.780
to realize that there are a few things that I'm leaving out.

02:51.780 --> 02:57.360
And it's all intentional because we cannot promise that we will get back to all of these, all the intricacies

02:57.720 --> 02:58.740
of compose.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.010
We'll talk about them later.

03:00.030 --> 03:04.890
But now just just trying to get something running so we can actually feel good about ourselves.

03:05.460 --> 03:05.880
Very OK.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.860
So we getting really close to finishing, finalizing our app.

03:08.910 --> 03:12.930
The next thing we're going to do is to make sure that when this button portfolio is clicked, we're

03:12.930 --> 03:20.760
going to show a list that will have some dummy data pertaining to our portfolio or this person's or

03:20.760 --> 03:22.140
this developer's portfolio.

03:22.290 --> 03:23.970
OK, so I'll see in the next video.

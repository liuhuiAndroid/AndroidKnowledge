00:00.420 --> 00:04.020
So in this section, we learned a lot of things we learned about navigation.

00:04.170 --> 00:10.050
The need for us to navigate, for instance, from one screen to the next and how traditionally we used

00:10.050 --> 00:13.950
to use just intents and start activity, which is fine.

00:14.070 --> 00:17.240
But until we get to the point where we need something more complex.

00:17.250 --> 00:23.160
So the solution in this case, we learn that there is these navigation components in Jetpack, which

00:23.160 --> 00:29.320
allows us to use the tools and libraries for handling complex navigation cases in Android.

00:29.910 --> 00:34.930
And so we also learned that navigation component has three major parts working together.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.750
The first one is navigation graph.

00:37.140 --> 00:41.130
Then we have nav hosts and host and the navigation controller.

00:41.370 --> 00:48.570
So each part that we talked about of the navigation component, we learned how to look at it as a diagram,

00:48.960 --> 00:50.370
as a hierarchy, if you will.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.380
So we have navigation component, which has, in this case, nav controller and sat nav controller.

00:55.380 --> 00:59.680
We will have enough host and nav host will have nav graph.

00:59.730 --> 01:06.360
So the graph in this case, the nav controller is the central API that instructs navigation to happen.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.570
For instance, it can say navigation that navigate and passing the route and do not host navigation

01:12.570 --> 01:12.960
host.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.200
This is where all the navigation graph items are hosted, so this is where everything is swapped out

01:19.200 --> 01:19.740
the show.

01:19.890 --> 01:26.460
Each composable destination or screen when users navigate to a new screen and the navigation graph,

01:26.460 --> 01:32.220
as the name implies, is just a graph that holds all of the items all of the composable, all of the

01:32.220 --> 01:32.820
screens.

01:33.390 --> 01:36.910
But most importantly, also these nodes, because it's a graph.

01:37.230 --> 01:41.580
They also carry more information about the navigation.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.200
This is what we've learned in this section.

01:45.240 --> 01:53.400
We use an example of a movie app where we have a list of courses and column using lazy column.

01:53.610 --> 01:59.490
And when we when we click on each item list we're getting, we're taken using navigation component were

01:59.510 --> 02:02.040
taken to a description screen.

02:02.190 --> 02:02.450
OK.

02:02.870 --> 02:07.980
Again, the nav graph just look at nav graph as screens, right?

02:08.220 --> 02:11.490
The composable in this case that users can navigate through.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.820
So I hope this section was helpful and I'll see you next time.

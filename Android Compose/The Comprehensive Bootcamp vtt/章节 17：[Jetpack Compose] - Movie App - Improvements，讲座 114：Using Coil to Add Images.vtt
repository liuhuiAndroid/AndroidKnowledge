WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:10.050
Let's see, how can we add the actual images, because remember in our movie file, we do have the poster

00:10.050 --> 00:15.060
and we have images so we can actually get these images from these links.

00:15.450 --> 00:15.840
OK?

00:16.320 --> 00:19.640
Images of the movie the first thing I want to make sure.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.040
So let's make this preview of all songs, a preview as such.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.140
But are we going to have a problem here?

00:25.140 --> 00:31.230
Because if you have over is going to say composable functions with non default parameters are not supported

00:31.230 --> 00:35.340
in preview unless they are annotated with preview parameter?

00:35.580 --> 00:42.480
Well, in this case here, all he's saying is that some of the parameters here must have some total

00:42.480 --> 00:43.350
default values.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.760
So for us, I'm just going to pass a say, get movies right?

00:47.990 --> 00:52.800
Remember, we remember these get movies, a return, a list of movies, and I'm just going to say I

00:52.800 --> 00:56.340
want to get the first movie, so we have some data default.

00:56.730 --> 01:01.890
So here this is another way of getting the first item from a list.

01:02.580 --> 01:09.770
So we call get movies which are returns at list and then we want the first index or index zero up there.

01:10.310 --> 01:10.620
All right.

01:10.950 --> 01:11.970
So get the first movie.

01:13.020 --> 01:14.010
Well, let's split it.

01:14.280 --> 01:15.600
Let's see what's going to happen.

01:16.860 --> 01:17.130
OK.

01:17.160 --> 01:17.760
There you have it.

01:17.910 --> 01:21.120
So this is what we see, nothing new there.

01:21.630 --> 01:25.590
So let's start with adding some more information here.

01:26.280 --> 01:32.820
So after our title here, what I'm going to do, actually, I'm going to create a column in this column

01:32.820 --> 01:33.180
here.

01:33.190 --> 01:38.400
We're going to get take all of this text and put inside of this column.

01:38.430 --> 01:44.430
The reason being is because we want to add other texts below the title.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.980
So let's go ahead first.

01:47.670 --> 01:51.630
I'm going to put a modifier here modifier.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.590
Keep a padding about four deep.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.870
OK, that seems to be what we always do.

01:58.530 --> 02:04.800
And let me copy this few times over just to show you a few things.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.530
OK, so the first we have a title.

02:08.130 --> 02:15.390
And while we're here, we may also add a modifier here and I want modifier.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.470
Let's say style one to modify his style.

02:19.980 --> 02:24.780
So let's add this style in this case, say material theme.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.190
I want typography.

02:26.700 --> 02:33.570
And let's say a six or not too large then for this tax here, I'm just going to say, let's put that

02:33.570 --> 02:35.790
inside of.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.620
Double quotes, because we are going to interpolate here.

02:42.830 --> 02:52.780
It's this is going to be director and let's say style for this one material theme, and we're going

02:52.780 --> 02:57.070
to go to typography again and we want to make it a caption so small.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.630
OK, let's go ahead and then get rid of this.

03:02.770 --> 03:05.800
In this case, I'm going to use the released.

03:08.230 --> 03:15.790
Such an was a movie that released, so just getting no, I think it's here, let's see, a year ago.

03:16.360 --> 03:21.580
Just getting the properties of the movie object might release you getting the year this movie was released.

03:22.450 --> 03:24.520
OK, let's go ahead and refresh will quit here.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.380
We should be able to see something, hopefully.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.540
OK, that looks real good.

03:29.080 --> 03:29.710
I like that.

03:30.880 --> 03:37.210
OK, now we need to work on the image because we don't want this icon just to show as it is right now.

03:37.220 --> 03:38.470
So we want to get rid of that.

03:38.470 --> 03:38.770
So.

03:39.270 --> 03:46.420
So how do we then bring in images, especially bring in images from a URL and compose?

03:47.480 --> 03:53.910
Well, there are a few ways, but there is one recommended way which is to use this library called coil.

03:54.160 --> 03:59.050
So coil is a library that allows us to get images from the URL, as you see here.

03:59.380 --> 04:05.710
If we go to this website, so we just Google Coil Jetpack Coil, as you see here, you will see that

04:05.710 --> 04:09.730
coil is a jetpack compose library that allows us to add images.

04:09.970 --> 04:16.270
There are other things that he can do with it, but mainly is to help us with adding images into our

04:16.270 --> 04:23.380
apps, using using your or in this case, if the image is at this URL, you can use image and then passed

04:23.380 --> 04:23.470
it.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.090
Remember image painter and so forth.

04:25.120 --> 04:31.270
Now this library is really helpful because it deals with all the underlining issues when he trying to

04:31.270 --> 04:33.580
get images from a URL.

04:33.940 --> 04:39.430
OK, so takes care of all the memory issues, everything that as developers in this case, we don't

04:39.430 --> 04:40.390
want to take care of.

04:40.930 --> 04:41.110
OK?

04:41.350 --> 04:46.240
It's really easy to use, but the first thing to do, of course, is to add the dependency, to say

04:46.240 --> 04:49.690
that we can get the library onto our project.

04:50.020 --> 04:57.100
So I'm going to copy this, or we can just click that their clipboard and what do you need to do?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.780
Let's go to our project and we need to go to Gradle scripts.

05:00.790 --> 05:06.490
So we take the second one to module movie app, double click and you can see we have a lot of other

05:06.490 --> 05:07.420
implementations there.

05:07.420 --> 05:14.020
So all we're going to do somewhere we can just go here, and I like to always add some sort of information.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.550
So I know what library.

05:15.550 --> 05:16.090
That's what.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.140
Or dependency.

05:17.500 --> 05:23.230
And let's go ahead and add that to their OK, so we have coil, and the next thing you need to do is

05:23.230 --> 05:25.090
to sync that way.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.560
The whole project a sync so we can start using this library after a few moments.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.640
Everything should be good.

05:31.790 --> 05:36.860
Just get out, get out of there, and now we can just comment this out.

05:37.190 --> 05:38.270
This is our icon.

05:38.810 --> 05:41.560
So here I'm just going to go ahead and say, say image.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.450
I say that and I'm going to use the first one.

05:44.450 --> 05:45.290
Is this painter.

05:45.830 --> 05:53.630
Now the thing we're going to do here, we're just going to start typing, remember and say, image painter

05:53.630 --> 05:54.140
like this.

05:54.140 --> 05:55.460
So we're going to use the first one.

05:55.820 --> 05:56.300
There we go.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.960
Actually, this is not what we want one to neither one, but it's OK.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.030
We can just overload it by saying data.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.320
So the data we're going to pass here is going to be the link, the URL.

06:06.620 --> 06:09.020
This case will be something like this, right?

06:09.410 --> 06:15.500
So where we get the image real, well, we get that from our object and that's a movie dot.

06:16.570 --> 06:23.350
And I'm going to see poster, but the problem with poster I learned, even though I added here, is

06:23.350 --> 06:25.150
that this is a broken link.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.890
So don't use poster.

06:26.890 --> 06:31.060
We're going to actually go and get one of these images, but there's a list of the image we can just

06:31.060 --> 06:32.350
go ahead and fetch one of them.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.070
OK.

06:33.670 --> 06:39.640
So instead of poster, which should be what we would get, we're just going to go and see get images

06:40.210 --> 06:43.180
and I'm going to get just the first image there.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.900
OK, from our list of images.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.520
And then here I'm going to say.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.740
Movie poster, such for content description.

06:54.070 --> 06:59.980
Now there's not thing that would happen because we are invoking remember image painter, which goes

06:59.980 --> 07:02.800
and tries to fetch an image from a URL.

07:03.220 --> 07:07.240
We need to go to a project again and add that permission.

07:07.400 --> 07:07.740
Right.

07:07.750 --> 07:12.160
Because Android is a protective is a protected box, if you will.

07:12.490 --> 07:18.610
Whenever we want to get something from a URL, we need to have the permission so we can say, use this

07:18.610 --> 07:20.380
permission like that, and he'd enter.

07:20.710 --> 07:23.050
And there is the internet if you don't see it.

07:23.350 --> 07:27.980
You can start typing internet like that and the first one, that's the one.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.820
So for a slash and closes itself.

07:31.180 --> 07:38.560
So this is what we need to do every time we want to use the internet to fetch images or to get something

07:38.560 --> 07:42.790
from the API or whatever we want to do whenever we want to access the internet.

07:43.060 --> 07:46.450
This has to be added into our Android manifest.

07:48.390 --> 07:53.610
At the time of the recording of these video images that we're getting from the internet don't show inside

07:53.610 --> 08:00.270
of a preview so we can go ahead and refresh that, even though we added in the image there.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.990
It's not going to show here, right?

08:04.000 --> 08:04.560
I see.

08:04.890 --> 08:05.760
It doesn't show.

08:06.420 --> 08:10.890
But the best way, of course, is to run in our immolated or your device.

08:10.950 --> 08:16.130
So in this case, I have my device here that you can see on the screen and we should see images.

08:16.140 --> 08:16.850
And voila!

08:16.890 --> 08:21.480
You can see now we went and got images for each one of the movies.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.280
Pretty neat.

08:23.460 --> 08:23.900
Very good.

08:23.910 --> 08:28.740
So if I click again, we go back to two details, which doesn't have anything.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.410
OK, so we're making good progress now.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.660
The great thing about this library, right?

08:33.660 --> 08:38.550
The coil, is that for our image, we can actually do something cool.

08:38.550 --> 08:44.790
For instance, we can invoke the builder right inside of our remember their let's go ahead and close

08:44.790 --> 08:46.800
this instead of our remember.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.350
I can see past something else.

08:49.350 --> 08:56.520
I'm going to pass the builder say builder like this and I'm going to pass Alhambra inside here.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.830
I can see, for instance, animation.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.500
I can say I want crossfade to happen.

09:02.130 --> 09:10.170
So let's say true to get a little animation when these images are being loaded.

09:10.770 --> 09:15.810
The other thing we can do, we can crop this image that is coming in into a circle.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.040
It's very easy.

09:17.040 --> 09:22.320
All you have to do have to invoke transformations and then pass here a circle.

09:23.490 --> 09:26.250
Crop transformation like that.

09:27.430 --> 09:32.050
All of that is being done inside of this builder parameter or argument, every passing.

09:33.430 --> 09:33.820
All right.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.620
And it's optional, obviously.

09:35.830 --> 09:37.480
OK, so now she'll run again.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.460
You will see the difference.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.640
You've seen this before, but now we're using the image painter in this case, the image coil.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.990
Remember image painter to do so, and you can see there we go.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.130
It looks very nice to have that nice circle image.

09:54.670 --> 10:00.970
And of course, we have the director and the release year for each one of the movies I get.

00:00.770 --> 00:04.260
So now let's go back to our portfolio and work on this.

00:04.280 --> 00:08.330
Obviously, we don't want these projects go here and get rid of that.

00:08.340 --> 00:09.650
So what is are we going to do?

00:09.740 --> 00:16.970
Well, we want to make sure that we have a list scrollable list that is that looks like this and that

00:16.970 --> 00:22.430
list is going to be fed with this data that it's been passed, as you see here, OK?

00:22.790 --> 00:23.720
So how do we do this?

00:24.230 --> 00:30.200
Well, first of all, we need a way in which we are able to create a list, right?

00:30.200 --> 00:34.940
A visual list such as this, which will have these cards as you see here, right?

00:35.360 --> 00:36.160
That's what we want to do.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.090
But let's start one thing at a time.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.830
First, let's accomplish one thing, which is how do we create a scrollable list?

00:43.250 --> 00:46.820
Well, luckily, it's really simple and compose.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.720
All you have to do is call this lazy column.

00:51.470 --> 00:55.130
OK, now the reason why we want to use a lazy column is twofold.

00:55.130 --> 00:59.930
One, you get the scroll ability of the list, whatever content you're going to be passing in.

01:00.380 --> 01:06.710
Number two, you also will get the advantage of recyclable views, which is really important, especially

01:06.710 --> 01:11.270
as you are passing in, for instance, a lot of data through.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.310
You want to use a lazy column.

01:13.700 --> 01:19.160
Lazy column will know how to recycle the views as they are being displayed.

01:19.460 --> 01:23.270
So lazy column, if you're an Android developer, is like a recycler view.

01:23.660 --> 01:24.440
But simpler.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.680
OK, so we can pass contents right away like that?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.360
Or we can just use a lambada.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.250
OK, so like this and while.

01:31.670 --> 01:37.740
So inside here now the lazy column will require a few things, one of which is the data in this case

01:37.770 --> 01:39.380
going to go through items.

01:40.010 --> 01:44.990
I'm going to use items like this because we're going to be passing a list of items.

01:44.990 --> 01:47.720
So there are different versions of this lambda or methods.

01:48.260 --> 01:49.250
So I'm going to use that one.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.910
And inside here, I'm going to pass.

01:50.930 --> 01:52.880
Of course, our data as such.

01:53.210 --> 01:59.330
Once you do that, you notice, then we can pass here a parameter which is going to be each item of

01:59.330 --> 02:00.320
our data.

02:00.350 --> 02:05.510
So I'm going to call it an item like that, and I can use either one of these helps that I have here

02:05.510 --> 02:10.410
to say these are just parameters that are being passed through our lambda again, lambda.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.090
If you've never heard of what a lambda is, it's OK in this case.

02:13.100 --> 02:19.850
Just think of it as a function that is anonymous and we can pass items through it, but in a more concise

02:19.850 --> 02:20.090
way.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.490
So I'm going to just use that first option there.

02:22.820 --> 02:27.500
So this means now this item is going to be a string because what would happen here?

02:27.500 --> 02:31.160
We're passing this data, which is what are we passing through, you know, items there?

02:31.490 --> 02:36.410
And when that happens, what happens is we are sifting through and getting each one of these items,

02:36.410 --> 02:41.810
which we have 100 strings in our list that we're passing when we call portfolio.

02:42.020 --> 02:46.250
Then to those, each one of them are going to be held in this item object.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.160
OK, so now I can do whatever I want.

02:49.490 --> 02:55.640
In this case, I'm just going to go ahead and say text just for now and pass the item like this because

02:55.640 --> 02:57.890
items are string and that will work anyway.

02:58.220 --> 03:03.500
You can see now because we're inside of a portfolio here and we that's inside of content, which means

03:03.980 --> 03:05.470
we're calling it here, right?

03:05.480 --> 03:07.020
And this has a preview.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.200
We can see that we have Project one, two and three.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.000
This is really good.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.050
So it's working.

03:12.380 --> 03:16.580
So if I add more projects this copy, there's a few times as such.

03:17.110 --> 03:21.050
You can go ahead and refresh and you can see we have all this project.

03:21.170 --> 03:22.810
Of course, some numbers are being repeated.

03:22.820 --> 03:23.480
That's OK.

03:23.720 --> 03:24.920
But you get the idea.

03:25.310 --> 03:26.050
This is really good.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.940
Just make sure that everything is aligned like that.

03:29.090 --> 03:30.170
OK, so it's working.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.930
Obviously, this is far from what we really want it to happen, but it is progress.

03:35.940 --> 03:37.400
So let's start small.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.390
Now let's go back to understand the whole idea of what are we trying to do?

03:41.750 --> 03:46.820
So what are we trying to do here is that when we click this portfolio button, in fact, when they first

03:46.820 --> 03:52.790
run this app and they come to this page, they being the users, we're not going to show anything.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.950
So this is going to be hidden, right?

03:55.220 --> 03:59.480
It's not until the portfolio button is clicked that we are going to show this.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.040
And when we click again portfolio, we don't hide it.

04:02.060 --> 04:08.630
So we're going to toggle this event that happens one click and then if it's shown, Click Again is going

04:08.630 --> 04:12.320
to hide this content area where we have the portfolios.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.310
How do we do that?

04:13.700 --> 04:14.000
OK.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.460
So let's think a little bit through.

04:16.700 --> 04:21.920
So if we go back to our button because this is where the action happens, right when we click, we don't

04:21.920 --> 04:25.250
want this anymore because we understand that this works and that's all that we needed.

04:25.850 --> 04:33.590
We want to make sure when this buttons clicked, then this content shows right whatever we have inside

04:33.590 --> 04:34.220
of this content.

04:34.490 --> 04:39.650
In this case, we have our portfolio here and we're passing project strings, right?

04:40.250 --> 04:40.730
That's neat.

04:40.790 --> 04:41.900
That's what needs to be shown.

04:42.230 --> 04:47.990
So if that's the case, that means then we have to figure out a way in which we can control the toggling

04:48.020 --> 04:48.800
of this button.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.890
Meaning if we click, then we want to show it.

04:51.920 --> 04:56.240
If it's showing our projects or being shown, then we want to hide that view.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.990
That takes us to another concept, which again, we are going.

05:00.080 --> 05:05.660
Who dive really deep into later again, we're just trying to get through this so we can see the basics

05:05.660 --> 05:06.260
of compose.

05:06.740 --> 05:13.160
So the concept here is very simple is that OK, we need to create a variable that will control or that

05:13.160 --> 05:15.170
will keep this state.

05:15.350 --> 05:21.260
It is a very crucial concept that will keep this state, whether it is false or true, true or false,

05:21.260 --> 05:26.240
so that we can toggle back and forth this view here when the buttons clicked.

05:26.720 --> 05:34.880
That just means then somewhere around here, I'm going to create a variable where say foul, say, button

05:35.960 --> 05:37.400
clicked state.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.270
Now this is not a simple variable.

05:40.280 --> 05:46.040
This is a different kind of variable that is very important in compose, and we will see into more details

05:46.040 --> 05:46.400
later.

05:46.730 --> 05:53.360
What this variable must be able to do is to remember this state of the button.

05:53.510 --> 05:58.340
And for that, we have a special syntax here we're going to see is equal to remember.

05:58.730 --> 06:00.080
Oh, interesting.

06:00.710 --> 06:06.470
Remember to pick the first one and I'm going to use the Lamp ID. Now, what is are we trying to remember

06:06.500 --> 06:07.700
when you set that up to?

06:07.850 --> 06:12.920
It's going to be a mutable state of a mouthful.

06:13.310 --> 06:16.220
At first is going to be a false value as such.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.310
OK, let's go ahead and think a little bit through this.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.630
So what we're doing here, we're creating a button, click state, and we're going to want it to remember

06:23.720 --> 06:24.910
this state, right?

06:24.920 --> 06:25.670
We say, remember?

06:25.850 --> 06:28.280
And it is indeed, of course, a function.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.360
But in this case, a lambda.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.040
That's why we have these curly braces.

06:31.310 --> 06:36.890
And then inside we're setting up the mutable state of these is the value type that needs to remember,

06:36.890 --> 06:39.050
which is the mutable state of and we passed.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.360
The actual Typekit in this case is going to be a Boolean.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.380
So true or false.

06:42.710 --> 06:47.000
So in this case, we're saying at the beginning, what are we going to try to remember in the form of

06:47.000 --> 06:47.510
this button?

06:47.510 --> 06:48.380
Click Variable.

06:48.860 --> 06:52.700
It's going to be a false Boolean, but it's very special here.

06:52.710 --> 06:53.660
Who must do like this?

06:54.230 --> 07:01.880
OK, so now we can use this now another thing you'll see you may end up having squiggly red lines between

07:01.880 --> 07:04.700
who remember and also mutable state or both them.

07:04.910 --> 07:10.850
All you have to do is to make the right point, so you have to right click and show context actions,

07:10.850 --> 07:13.010
or it will tell you exactly that.

07:13.010 --> 07:15.590
You need to import and go ahead and import, as we've done before.

07:15.830 --> 07:16.720
It's very important, OK?

07:17.510 --> 07:21.560
But in this case, here you see that I didn't have to do much because he just detected that I didn't.

07:21.770 --> 07:24.560
I needed those libraries and went ahead and got it, in fact.

07:24.950 --> 07:31.130
You can see somewhere we have their mutable state of and we have to remember if you have those issues

07:31.130 --> 07:33.290
as make sure that you import as such.

07:33.860 --> 07:34.340
All right.

07:34.550 --> 07:35.500
Let's come back here.

07:35.510 --> 07:37.550
So we have a button click state.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.890
So where do we set it or use this?

07:39.920 --> 07:44.030
Well, we use it inside of one click stadia is in the beginning.

07:44.030 --> 07:48.590
Obviously, this button click state is going to be false, and that's fine because we don't want to

07:48.590 --> 07:49.520
show anything.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.240
OK?

07:50.330 --> 07:54.230
So when we click on it, we're going to set it in one state button.

07:54.230 --> 07:56.960
Click State, was it Dot?

07:56.960 --> 07:58.760
Want to get the value right?

07:59.060 --> 08:03.530
And going to set it to what I'm going to set it to true.

08:03.890 --> 08:05.570
Because in the beginning it's always false.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.020
But that's not all good.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.720
This is going to be just one part of the equation.

08:09.170 --> 08:15.260
I want to target between true or false, so I'm going to just put the whatever is this state, we just

08:15.260 --> 08:16.070
get the opposite.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.870
This is how we toggle it.

08:18.470 --> 08:18.710
OK.

08:18.920 --> 08:24.200
So meaning if it's true and going to set it true, but that's not the whole story because we don't want

08:24.200 --> 08:24.340
it.

08:24.350 --> 08:27.890
Just when you click said it's all true and then we're done right.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.500
We want to be able to say, OK, when that button is clicked, we are going to toggle it.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.960
So meaning we're going to take the value that is current, right?

08:35.960 --> 08:41.190
When we just copy that and then we're going to make it the opposite of what it is.

08:41.240 --> 08:45.920
So if the value is false, then we're going to toggle to true.

08:46.340 --> 08:47.710
If you click again, it's going to be false.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.960
So he's going to toggle back and forth.

08:48.980 --> 08:49.730
This is how you do it.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.140
OK, there we go.

08:51.620 --> 08:55.790
So to see this, if it works, what I'm going to do here, then let's click here.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.100
Make sure that we are outside of our button.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.780
OK, portfolio is there.

09:01.130 --> 09:03.230
So outside here, I'm going to say something.

09:03.230 --> 09:04.630
If right?

09:04.820 --> 09:06.440
Let's check if this is indeed true.

09:07.360 --> 09:15.470
We can say if button clicks state that value is true, if we just leave as that, if that's true, if

09:15.470 --> 09:17.330
it's true, then I'm going to go.

09:17.330 --> 09:21.860
I say, call this content like this, it's going to show that content.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.680
Else, I'm just going to go ahead and show nothing but to show nothing.

09:26.680 --> 09:31.250
I'm going to say box such and pass nothing like this.

09:31.910 --> 09:32.750
Let's see this true.

09:32.780 --> 09:38.570
Let's go ahead and actually run this on an emulator and see, OK, so there we go.

09:38.610 --> 09:39.380
Moment of truth.

09:39.410 --> 09:44.870
If I click voila, we see all the project are showing and it could scroll up and down.

09:44.870 --> 09:48.860
But since there aren't enough, there are filling out the entire space.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.940
I don't see the scrolling, but it's OK if I click back is going to hide that.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.440
All right, so it is working.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.060
This is exactly what we wanted.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.750
OK, so before we go, because this is again too long, I just want to go.

09:59.920 --> 10:05.520
Again, what we did here, so we went ahead and created our content as we saw before, and we called

10:05.530 --> 10:11.980
the portfolio passing data dummy data indicates just strength when we separated our code a little bit

10:11.980 --> 10:13.030
to make it better.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.870
We created the actual portfolio composable and passing the list.

10:17.230 --> 10:23.410
And inside here we have the lazy column, which is corresponding to recycle view in Android development,

10:23.410 --> 10:27.280
which this is still Android development, but a subset of another development, if you will.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.210
This is composed, right?

10:28.220 --> 10:30.100
So this takes care of everything.

10:30.100 --> 10:35.440
You don't have to worry about adapters or all the things that we had to worry about in traditional Android

10:35.440 --> 10:35.860
development.

10:36.040 --> 10:41.350
And so we passed that data and this case just passing the strings as the row was, if you will.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.410
So that's what it's happening inside here.

10:44.680 --> 10:44.940
OK.

10:45.190 --> 10:51.430
And so when we click the button, first of all, we created these mutable state in Remember here, so

10:51.430 --> 10:57.190
it's a very special variable that will always remember a state of this Boolean.

10:57.580 --> 11:01.120
And so what we did is when we clicked, we are going to toggle that button.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.870
So if it's true, then it is going to be false when clicked in and vice versa.

11:05.290 --> 11:10.090
And when that happens, we're going to attach if statement to say, OK, if it's true, the button state

11:10.090 --> 11:10.480
is true.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.890
That means you want the content to show which in this case, we're going to pull in the content else.

11:14.890 --> 11:21.340
We're just going to have an empty box and hence you're able to see this wonderful effect there.

11:21.820 --> 11:22.310
All right.

11:22.330 --> 11:25.300
So we're making good progress, and I hope this is making sense.

11:25.450 --> 11:29.170
If not, again, don't worry, we are going to go over this so many times.

11:29.440 --> 11:35.200
You're going to be so, so tired and sick of me going over all of these great things.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.730
But don't worry, I won't get you bored.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.930
But this is what are we doing here?

11:38.950 --> 11:44.140
Ladies and gentlemen, and I hope you are having lots of fun and that this is making some sense at least,

11:44.470 --> 11:45.760
and I hope you're excited.

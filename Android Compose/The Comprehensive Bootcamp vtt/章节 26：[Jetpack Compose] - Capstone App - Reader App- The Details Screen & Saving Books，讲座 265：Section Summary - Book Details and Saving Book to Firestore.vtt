00:00.720 --> 00:07.560
All right, so we've done a lot in this section, so we started by looking at the book detail so users

00:07.560 --> 00:15.480
can go to details and see exactly the book that, if clicked, the book that if search for, let's say,

00:16.530 --> 00:23.790
baking right and they can search books and go and they can see the details of that book.

00:24.270 --> 00:31.260
And most importantly, we also able to create ways in which we can retrieve books from our review model.

00:31.260 --> 00:37.920
We looked at produce state in order to produce this state inside of our composable so we can get the

00:37.920 --> 00:39.240
information from our review model.

00:39.930 --> 00:42.180
So we really do a lot of things here, OK?

00:42.180 --> 00:48.990
And we culminated the whole section with being able to save a book into our database.

00:49.110 --> 00:53.100
So now we're able to go and say, save this book and we can go back.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.270
Of course we see nothing.

00:54.270 --> 01:00.540
But if you go back to our database refresh, we are able to see that indeed, we save this book, this

01:00.540 --> 01:01.080
new book.

01:02.070 --> 01:03.060
I think this is the one.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.270
No, that's not the one.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.060
James Ferguson dishes, right?

01:07.110 --> 01:10.320
So this is the one we just save now, which is about baking.

01:10.890 --> 01:11.220
OK.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.150
So this is real good.

01:12.450 --> 01:17.970
So now what do we need to do is to be able to, of course, when we save something, all the books that

01:17.970 --> 01:24.180
we've saved, we want to be able to go back home and see, of course, the list of those books, right,

01:24.180 --> 01:29.910
at least in the reading list, because we add the book, we want to put them in this category until,

01:29.910 --> 01:32.520
of course, they click this category, book here.

01:32.790 --> 01:35.350
And then we change the status of the book.

01:35.370 --> 01:39.030
Then they're going to be in the Reading Now section.

01:39.880 --> 01:40.890
OK, so we're getting there.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.840
Our app is close to being done.

01:43.170 --> 01:47.670
We still have a little bit more work to do, which we are going to continue in the next session.

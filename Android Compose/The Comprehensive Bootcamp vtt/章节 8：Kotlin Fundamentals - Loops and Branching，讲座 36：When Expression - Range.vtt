00:00.550 --> 00:07.120
So with one here, one expression, you can also check a value for being in or not in a range.

00:07.450 --> 00:07.750
OK.

00:07.810 --> 00:11.040
So what that means is, for instance, to say 100 here, right?

00:11.040 --> 00:13.860
I can change this to say something like this in this.

00:13.930 --> 00:18.880
That's a key word there in between one and, let's say, 100.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.130
I want to print something like this amount is between one and 100, something like that.

00:27.320 --> 00:27.550
OK.

00:27.820 --> 00:33.940
So if I change this to 99, the amount, because remember, this is what governs the entire expression

00:33.940 --> 00:34.210
here.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.230
Let's go ahead and run.

00:35.860 --> 00:42.400
Can see this amount is between one and a hundred and we can do the opposite, which is to check if something

00:42.400 --> 00:43.510
is not in range.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.280
So what do we do?

00:44.290 --> 00:52.270
We say exclamation point, which means not right in range between 10 90, something like this.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.800
This amount is outside the range.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.460
Saron.

00:57.580 --> 01:01.060
OK, so this is running because it's cocked here.

01:01.390 --> 01:04.810
But if I put the zero, let's go and run.

01:04.990 --> 01:09.790
This amount is outside arranged anything that is outside the range of between 10 and 90.

01:10.060 --> 01:13.000
It's going to go in line this statement here.

01:13.450 --> 01:13.780
Oops.

01:13.780 --> 01:15.160
I made a mistake here and there.

01:15.580 --> 01:15.830
OK.

01:16.120 --> 01:21.490
So there are a lot of things you can do with one expression, and you see it's really simple to set

01:21.490 --> 01:21.680
up.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.820
You can put as many cases as you need here.

01:24.970 --> 01:26.800
OK, so go ahead and play with this concept.

01:26.890 --> 01:28.570
It's pretty fun, and I'll see you next.

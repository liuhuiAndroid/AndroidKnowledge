00:00.210 --> 00:04.100
The other thing I notice here is that we still have this 100, right?

00:04.200 --> 00:07.250
12 out of 100 question that is shown here.

00:07.260 --> 00:11.910
So this is a hard coded number that we added earlier.

00:12.390 --> 00:13.400
That's not what we want.

00:13.470 --> 00:13.840
Let's see.

00:13.890 --> 00:14.490
Go back.

00:14.850 --> 00:17.160
This is out of 100.

00:17.310 --> 00:23.490
This is what we added earlier, which is not what we want when we want to get in this case.

00:24.340 --> 00:29.700
Want to get out of all questions that we have in our JASON payload.

00:30.450 --> 00:31.110
How do we do that?

00:31.260 --> 00:32.670
Of course, I know you can do this.

00:33.630 --> 00:36.840
In fact, you can pause this video and try to do that.

00:37.770 --> 00:38.130
All right.

00:38.220 --> 00:39.810
So I hope you were able to do it.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.820
Now, let's think a little bit about this.

00:41.820 --> 00:51.570
So we understand in order for us to get the data in this case, the how many questions we have, how

00:51.570 --> 00:55.410
many questions we have is just the size of our list.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.690
So there are few ways to do this.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.810
One of ways I'm going to do, I'm going to use our view model.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.740
So can I go and save you moral questions if you model?

01:05.250 --> 01:10.390
And here, because we have our data, we should have received our data at this point here because it

01:10.410 --> 01:13.500
would initially go ahead and factually data and everything.

01:13.800 --> 01:19.290
So this data here is a mutable state, but also contains these data or exception, which contains our

01:19.440 --> 01:20.340
list of questions.

01:20.650 --> 01:20.920
Right.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.510
So I'm going to create a function at the bottom here.

01:25.470 --> 01:29.580
Call get total question.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.170
Count.

01:37.420 --> 01:40.210
So this will just return and end, right?

01:40.870 --> 01:44.760
And so I'm going to say return data and value.

01:46.030 --> 01:53.110
I'm going to go invoke the actual data entry list and get to mutable list.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.660
I need to do that and then get the site.

01:55.930 --> 02:06.400
We're going to have some issues here because we need to make these nhlapo such that we go, there we

02:06.400 --> 02:06.550
go.

02:06.550 --> 02:10.840
So now, because we have our question, the model, we can go to our questions.

02:11.080 --> 02:18.280
And you'll remember that we are also passing the view model into our question here.

02:18.730 --> 02:23.290
This place that we have access, not a few models, so we can do that now can use it.

02:23.710 --> 02:31.780
So inside of a final question tracker, here I have the counter move past that already now against a

02:31.780 --> 02:32.830
say view model.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.130
OK.

02:35.740 --> 02:36.630
That get.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.630
Tomorrow, question count like this.

02:41.860 --> 02:48.700
And if you go ahead and run, we should get this will now change to a total question count.

02:49.690 --> 02:50.230
And there we go.

02:51.460 --> 02:56.420
We have zero out of four thousand eight hundred and seventy five questions.

02:56.440 --> 02:56.740
Wow.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.830
I will take you a little while to go through that.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.490
Well, so.

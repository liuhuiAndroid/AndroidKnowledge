WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:06.810
Let's put together this user interface component here that allows us to have this very nice elevated

00:06.990 --> 00:07.940
card per se.

00:08.310 --> 00:09.570
Let's see, how can we do that?

00:09.840 --> 00:14.640
So now we have created a surface which is this entire canvas here.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.930
Let's go ahead and put together that card entity.

00:16.950 --> 00:23.010
Well, as the name implies, there is in fact a UI function user interface function that we can call

00:23.190 --> 00:24.620
to create just that.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.040
And it's called card.

00:26.130 --> 00:26.520
There we go.

00:26.580 --> 00:27.990
So you start typing card again.

00:27.990 --> 00:34.590
You can see here it is indeed a function that is a composable function, which means comes from the

00:34.590 --> 00:37.290
compose library jetpack compose library.

00:37.320 --> 00:42.780
So all of this is already done for us, so we're just invoking lost functions and get the results.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.100
How neat is that, right?

00:44.310 --> 00:46.830
OK, so now we're going to see enter to get that.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.170
So we have the card on the beta of the card here.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.450
If you hover over, this is another amazing thing.

00:51.750 --> 00:56.190
There's a lot of information that you'll will see here, and most of it make no sense to you, and that's

00:56.190 --> 00:56.820
fine again.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.190
We're just getting something done here.

00:59.280 --> 00:59.610
OK.

01:00.030 --> 01:03.870
So just follow along and we'll have plenty of time to go over all these things.

01:03.870 --> 01:04.830
All these details.

01:05.100 --> 01:05.410
OK.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.090
No problem.

01:06.300 --> 01:06.510
All right.

01:06.510 --> 01:07.740
So it's a composable function.

01:07.860 --> 01:13.860
If you have all we can see and you can see here is this function card and has this composable at composable

01:13.860 --> 01:16.080
there to say this is indeed a composable function.

01:16.350 --> 01:22.590
And then we have this modifier here and we'll find again, it allows us to modify the contents of that

01:22.590 --> 01:27.460
function and we can perhaps shape to say what kind of shape we want, background color of this shape

01:27.460 --> 01:29.520
of content, color and all sorts of things.

01:30.060 --> 01:30.540
Wonderful.

01:30.630 --> 01:37.560
So the first thing I want to do, of course, is put a modifier I can hit enter when I say modifier

01:37.620 --> 01:44.850
can modify my diet with because I want to control the width of this card.

01:45.150 --> 01:45.440
OK.

01:45.510 --> 01:49.950
So if say with like that, you see a few options when the first option, which is we're going to be

01:49.950 --> 01:52.500
able to pass a with value.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.870
OK, so in this case, I just want 200 and now we need to pass the actual unit size.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.750
OK, so I'm going to say that dpi like this now.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.290
What is this deep deep is Android unit measure.

02:04.290 --> 02:08.250
So this is how Android measures the pixels that we are needing.

02:08.310 --> 02:10.140
Height, width and all sorts of things.

02:10.290 --> 02:16.890
Just think of it as just a measuring system or measuring unit with Android has a lot with it, but that's

02:16.890 --> 02:18.300
what we are going to go with for that.

02:18.420 --> 02:18.720
All right.

02:19.170 --> 02:24.010
But we have a problem here because that says that we need to actually import the library, this unit

02:24.010 --> 02:24.630
to the library.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.420
So what we can do here, I can say alt or option on the window in the air like this.

02:29.430 --> 02:34.740
And while it's important you can see for the wider top here, you know imports, this may be closed

02:34.740 --> 02:35.200
for you.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.500
You can just actually click to the left there.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.120
You can see this is what was imported, so we're able to use that library.

02:42.480 --> 02:42.780
All right.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.780
So we have that done.

02:44.790 --> 02:51.030
So now the width of this card, it's going to be 200 and we can pile on onto our modifier.

02:51.030 --> 02:52.040
So we hit enter.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.070
I say again.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.040
I can say I want in this case, at the height, the height, we're going to put 390 dpi again right

02:59.220 --> 02:59.610
there again.

02:59.970 --> 03:05.070
If you want to continue to add more modifiers, more things to customize our card, you can.

03:05.070 --> 03:06.540
But we're going to stop here for now.

03:06.630 --> 03:11.340
Anything we want to do is we want to give this card some sort of elevation.

03:11.340 --> 03:18.120
What that means is that if you look at our card here, you notice that we have some sort of shadow around,

03:18.120 --> 03:24.800
which makes it look like it's elevated from the main background canvas or, in this case, surface.

03:24.810 --> 03:28.000
So we can actually set that up and say how elevated we want.

03:28.020 --> 03:34.170
So meaning how much of this shadow we want wanted to show so it pops from the canvas?

03:34.480 --> 03:37.360
OK, so we can do that by, say, comma hit enter.

03:37.410 --> 03:39.570
Notice this is not part of the modifier anymore.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.040
This is a different property.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.600
And so was the elevation.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.320
Start typing.

03:43.410 --> 03:45.120
You can see there it is, says here.

03:45.120 --> 03:50.070
Right away it's elevation and we must pass a DPI unit for it.

03:50.190 --> 03:54.060
So I want to say I want about, let's say for that dpi.

03:54.120 --> 03:54.630
There we go.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.920
Now let's go ahead and refresh.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.900
See if we're going to see anything.

03:58.140 --> 04:00.600
OK, so it's done refreshed, but we see nothing.

04:00.630 --> 04:03.780
In fact, if I keep going here, let's go and see.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.000
It doesn't look like there's anything, but there is something.

04:07.020 --> 04:11.240
It's just that there's more to do to make it look like this, right?

04:11.460 --> 04:12.990
So there are other properties we need to pass.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.460
What are those other properties?

04:14.700 --> 04:16.070
Well, the card is there.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.480
We understand that we're not seeing it because it's white on white and there is really we haven't delineated

04:21.480 --> 04:22.020
everything.

04:22.020 --> 04:25.440
So what do we need to do next is to pass in a shape.

04:25.590 --> 04:30.690
Now, if you have a over cardigan, cardigan can see there is, of course, a type or parameter or in

04:30.690 --> 04:32.880
this case, a property we can past called shape.

04:32.880 --> 04:33.660
We're going to use that.

04:33.690 --> 04:38.160
Now, what are we going to do is after elevation or even before elevation, really?

04:38.370 --> 04:41.140
And when I say shape, this is equal.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.140
And for us here, for a shape, what do we need to do?

04:44.160 --> 04:45.690
I'm going to say rounded.

04:45.870 --> 04:50.370
You can actually start tightening rounded corners, shapes this water corner shape.

04:50.370 --> 04:56.010
As the name imply, it's going to create rounded corners of the entire shape, all of the edges.

04:56.010 --> 04:57.320
But we need to pass something else.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.050
We need to pass it.

04:58.050 --> 04:59.370
There's a different thing which can pass.

04:59.380 --> 04:59.700
We can I.

04:59.800 --> 05:05.230
Really said I would say, OK, I want to top start to be 10 dpi four instead, which means the corner

05:05.230 --> 05:07.380
is not going to be as sharp, right?

05:07.390 --> 05:07.920
So desired.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.210
No, the sharper the corner is.

05:10.270 --> 05:14.800
Or in this case, the round the corner is, I should say, but I want make sure that all the corners

05:14.980 --> 05:17.590
are actually same roundness, if you will.

05:17.830 --> 05:23.980
So I could just pass he or say corner this hit enter, I'm going to pass a corner type you will and

05:23.980 --> 05:27.280
pass this size there to the size again is going to be DPI.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.390
So I'm going to say I want to be about 15 dpi like this.

05:31.660 --> 05:36.580
So now what I'm saying again, is that I'm going to put a sheep onto this card so that this card has

05:36.580 --> 05:42.640
a rounded corners shape and a passing the size of the radius per say of each corner.

05:42.760 --> 05:47.710
Let's see if we're going to be able to see something, and you can see probably let's make this really,

05:47.710 --> 05:48.370
really, really.

05:48.580 --> 05:52.860
You can see now there is indeed a little corner out there, right?

05:52.870 --> 05:53.740
It's rounded.

05:53.740 --> 05:54.670
It's not too much.

05:54.670 --> 05:57.730
But is there one thing I can do to make this more visible?

05:57.730 --> 06:00.300
It's I'm going to change the color of on a card.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.300
That way it's more visible.

06:01.480 --> 06:06.160
In fact, again, if you have over a card, you can see we have that property of background color.

06:06.220 --> 06:09.300
So right after shape, I can come up here and say.

06:09.340 --> 06:13.390
Background color, such forget the color.

06:13.420 --> 06:18.130
And then here I'm going to say color, evoke this color function, say Dot.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.260
And I just want to say green for now.

06:20.290 --> 06:25.720
This will just let us be able to actually see the difference between the background as in the surface,

06:25.930 --> 06:30.070
right in the background of the card, so it can see that this is actually working.

06:30.250 --> 06:33.490
The shape is rounded, corners shape refresh again.

06:33.670 --> 06:35.050
And now you can see the difference.

06:35.170 --> 06:35.830
There it is.

06:35.860 --> 06:38.410
I know this is a very aggressive color, but bear with me here.

06:38.410 --> 06:38.830
You can see.

06:38.830 --> 06:39.370
There it is.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.240
We do have those corners there.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.290
In fact, you look at the bottom to there go.

06:44.650 --> 06:45.570
All right, that's good.

06:45.580 --> 06:46.150
That's really good.

06:46.150 --> 06:51.010
And anything we can do, we can actually add a padding around the entire card.

06:51.250 --> 06:55.930
So instead of our modifier here, I'm going to come up and say, dot padding.

06:55.930 --> 06:59.140
This padding is going to have a padding around the entire card.

06:59.140 --> 07:02.950
So I'm going to say 12 dpi, such as go ahead and rebuild.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.120
Is this a normal size since we have seen that this is actually working?

07:07.390 --> 07:08.140
OK, there we go.

07:08.340 --> 07:14.590
Now you can see it's much better and you can see now that because we added that padding around this

07:14.590 --> 07:15.640
card here, right?

07:15.790 --> 07:17.500
That's what we are building.

07:17.710 --> 07:18.490
We have 12.

07:18.490 --> 07:22.690
So the bigger this number, of course, the more padding, which means the more difference we will see

07:22.690 --> 07:28.570
between the background and our card case, the more padding that means you padding around it, making

07:28.570 --> 07:29.260
it a little bit smaller.

07:29.530 --> 07:30.580
OK, so this is working.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.240
This is really good.

07:31.420 --> 07:36.850
In fact, now I can get rid of this hideous color and let's just put something like white, even though

07:36.850 --> 07:41.710
we know that white is is the color that is given automatically as default.

07:41.710 --> 07:44.140
But I just want to show you other alternatives here.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.220
OK, so there we go, and I know it's really hard to see, but there you go.

07:48.310 --> 07:49.280
It's not too bad.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.400
You can see now there it is.

07:51.640 --> 07:52.760
It's it's showing.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.400
So now we have the actual card on top of our surface.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.910
So it's starting to look a lot like this, least the background.

08:01.000 --> 08:01.360
All right.

08:01.630 --> 08:02.050
Very good.

08:02.110 --> 08:05.260
So while we're here, let's go ahead and see if we can run this because we have something.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.420
Let's run this onto our device.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.680
There are two things you can do.

08:08.690 --> 08:13.780
We can go ahead, of course, and run this because this still is an application Android application

08:14.050 --> 08:15.880
and run this directly from here.

08:16.210 --> 08:18.550
Or we can just go ahead and run it from here.

08:18.670 --> 08:20.170
It says it will deploy preview.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.460
I can just right click there.

08:21.490 --> 08:24.490
It should go ahead and start realizing an emulator.

08:24.490 --> 08:29.260
It says no emulators are currently running and we can change that rule quick.

08:29.890 --> 08:31.000
OK, it's connecting.

08:31.150 --> 08:34.390
Actually should have just waited a little bit until it started connecting.

08:34.570 --> 08:35.450
And voila!

08:35.470 --> 08:38.740
You can see we have now and I just let someone down.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.890
I have the same later and can see it looks really good.

08:41.920 --> 08:46.390
We have that nice card rounded corner card showing there.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.350
OK, great.

08:47.830 --> 08:55.120
So the moral of the story here is, I hope you can see how easy really things are now with Compose to

08:55.120 --> 08:59.110
create these amazing, good looking user interfaces.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.810
We didn't have to do a lot of work.

09:00.820 --> 09:06.880
We just passed in a modifier and said, for instance, we want this surface to take up the entire width

09:06.880 --> 09:07.480
of the screen.

09:07.810 --> 09:12.760
We want to take up the entire height of a screen and then inside of this surface, this canvas, this

09:12.970 --> 09:17.290
back background there another white one, one to put a card in inside of this card.

09:17.290 --> 09:22.690
We want to also make this card a little bit smaller and width 200 dpi height 390.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.630
And then we're going to create a padding around it, a card.

09:25.630 --> 09:30.660
So padding around this whole card here, right of twelve dpi.

09:30.670 --> 09:35.170
And then we said the shape should be, of course, have it, corner size of 15 DB.

09:35.170 --> 09:39.910
So the higher this number, the rounder, this will be these corners.

09:40.090 --> 09:42.730
They're right and say with background color.

09:42.730 --> 09:47.740
In fact, we can just get rid of that because the default is always white and it'll say elevations are

09:47.740 --> 09:50.950
going to be four dpi, which means going to be visible.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.630
It's going to be higher on top of our surface that we created over again.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.680
So as we go through this, please go ahead and type as AMD.

10:00.490 --> 10:07.270
And break things tried to change, for instance, the padding and see what happens or add, make this

10:07.270 --> 10:12.490
larger or perhaps change the color as it showed you, or change the corner size.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.760
Deep inside there and see what will transpire here or inside of our preview.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.600
So that's a really good exercise I like to do.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.130
And let's keep going.

00:00.180 --> 00:01.680
Well, hello and welcome.

00:01.830 --> 00:06.300
So what I'm going to do in the next few minutes is do some introductions, so at least, you know,

00:06.300 --> 00:08.520
who am I and what is this course about?

00:08.730 --> 00:11.220
OK, so let's start with who am I?

00:11.310 --> 00:12.750
Well, my name is politician.

00:12.870 --> 00:16.350
I'm a software engineer and mobile developer, among other things.

00:16.410 --> 00:20.250
So but at the heart of all of that, I am an instructor and a teacher.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.310
I love teaching programming.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.890
I love teaching people how to think about programming and so forth.

00:26.220 --> 00:32.520
OK, so that's who I am, and I take my job as an instructor very seriously because it is one of my

00:32.520 --> 00:33.330
biggest passions.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.920
Now what is this course about?

00:35.400 --> 00:40.050
In this course, we're going to learn about Jetpack Compose, which is a modern Android development

00:40.170 --> 00:43.920
tool that allows us to build apps in a different way.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.970
So with Jetpack Compose, we use Kotlin to create declarative UI.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.130
So it's a different mindset when it comes to building mobile Android apps.

00:56.430 --> 00:59.520
So that is what we're going to be focusing on in this course.

00:59.900 --> 01:05.310
Now, one other thing I'd like to discuss before we move forward is a way in which you can get the most

01:05.310 --> 01:06.300
out of this course.

01:06.510 --> 01:11.430
So I understand most of us have different ways to approach things, especially when we're learning.

01:11.430 --> 01:18.510
But this is what I find helpful for students to retain what they're going to be learning, especially

01:18.510 --> 01:19.860
when it comes to programming.

01:20.010 --> 01:24.790
OK, so first of all, I may give you certain challenges or exercises for you to do.

01:24.870 --> 01:29.310
Don't skip those, go ahead and do those because those will help you retain the material.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.870
The thing is, are we trying to accomplish?

01:30.870 --> 01:35.340
Which is to learn how to build Android apps in this case with compose?

01:35.910 --> 01:40.230
And of course, because this is a video course, which means you're going to be watching me code, you

01:40.230 --> 01:41.130
will do just that.

01:41.130 --> 01:47.790
You watch me code along, but you will do a little bit differently because you will code along with

01:47.790 --> 01:48.240
me.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.350
That is very important.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.970
So don't be just any spectator.

01:51.090 --> 01:54.890
I would like you to actually type as I type as well.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.330
So that's part of the whole learning process.

01:57.570 --> 02:01.590
And everything is programming can be daunting at times.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.180
And so when you feel overwhelmed, it's OK to stop arrest.

02:05.190 --> 02:12.630
Go get some fresh air, coffee, tea, whatever it is that you like to drink to just rest a little bit,

02:12.630 --> 02:16.380
OK, and once you've rested, you can come back and keep at it.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.460
OK, very well.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.470
Now what are the course prerequisites?

02:19.680 --> 02:23.970
Well, it will be very helpful if you know some basics of Android development.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.770
OK, so meaning that if you've done a little bit of an Android development or mobile development in

02:28.770 --> 02:31.740
general, that will be extremely helpful, obviously.

02:31.860 --> 02:38.820
However, in this course is not entirely required because I go through the basics so that you are at

02:38.820 --> 02:43.020
that level that it's needed for you to start building Android apps using Compose.

02:43.170 --> 02:43.470
OK.

02:43.590 --> 02:49.500
So if you are not an Android developer, you've not done enough development and this course is still

02:49.500 --> 02:50.100
for you.

02:50.250 --> 02:54.180
It's not a problem because I go through stuff, but if you already have some experience, this course

02:54.180 --> 02:56.220
is equally useful to you.

02:56.280 --> 03:02.040
So you would be fine because we are going to be using Kotlin, having a basic understanding of with

03:02.040 --> 03:08.280
the Catalan language or any modern, object oriented programming language, for that matter, is a big

03:08.280 --> 03:08.760
plus.

03:08.790 --> 03:16.020
But if you don't have those skills, if you haven't really done any object oriented programming or any

03:16.020 --> 03:21.390
programming in general, it's OK in so many ways because I will cover Kotlin basics in this course.

03:21.510 --> 03:25.130
But if you want to be ahead of the curve, it's not going to hurt you.

03:25.140 --> 03:31.950
If you could pick up a book or just do some brush up on killing, but also remember I will cover Kotlin

03:31.950 --> 03:33.240
and of course, as well.

03:33.420 --> 03:39.720
For those of you who want to brush up on Kotlin or want to brush up on programming concepts in general,

03:39.750 --> 03:45.660
OK, so this course is supposed to be a comprehensive course, meaning that it will take you from where

03:45.660 --> 03:49.530
you are to understanding how to build Android apps using compose.

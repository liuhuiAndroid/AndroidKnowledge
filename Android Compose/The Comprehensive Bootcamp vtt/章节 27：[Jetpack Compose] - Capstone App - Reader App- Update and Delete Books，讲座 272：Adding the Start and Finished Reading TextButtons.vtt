WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:01.060
All right.

00:01.200 --> 00:04.110
So let's go ahead and see if we can put this structure here now.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.800
You will see that to make this to work.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.020
Of course, these are text buttons.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.320
You'll see that will click when we click on Start Reading.

00:13.530 --> 00:19.890
This will change color, meaning it's going to we're going to disable it to look like cannot be clicked

00:19.890 --> 00:20.460
again, right?

00:21.120 --> 00:31.980
Let's add a row because everything is side by side modifier vertical alignment, the one center vertically

00:33.180 --> 00:35.160
horizontal arrangement.

00:37.690 --> 00:42.340
To start, OK, let's add a text button.

00:43.390 --> 00:46.210
There's different kinds of buttons, text buttons and so forth.

00:46.810 --> 00:50.530
And then right after that, I'm going to say enabled.

00:51.790 --> 00:52.900
Now here's the thing.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.650
How are we going to know whether this is enable or not?

00:56.680 --> 01:05.200
Well, the idea is this is going to be enabled if they started reading field from our database because

01:05.200 --> 01:07.660
we're going to have we have that field, right?

01:08.650 --> 01:12.460
If they started reading field is no.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.830
That makes sense because we want to make it enabled to say, well, you can enable it now because we

01:18.130 --> 01:24.490
haven't started, so we can do that by checking our book.

01:26.050 --> 01:32.890
Say, started reading his novel, then we're going to take whatever.

01:33.370 --> 01:36.130
If it's true, then this is going to be enabled.

01:36.190 --> 01:38.530
If it's false, then is this going to be disabled?

01:39.250 --> 01:46.210
What I'm going to do inside also going to check something else and say if in this case is started,

01:46.210 --> 01:47.770
which we haven't created yet.

01:50.080 --> 01:57.190
So they started reading Let's Create is started reading our top here and say, remember?

02:00.280 --> 02:11.020
Mutable state, state of the city falls, OK, back here, so if is started reading.

02:12.380 --> 02:20.270
Is the opposite, that value is not true, so it's it's the opposite of what it is at this point.

02:20.990 --> 02:31.070
What I'm going to do, I'm going to add a text here that will say started reading, she's going to toggle

02:31.070 --> 02:31.940
back and forth.

02:31.940 --> 02:32.300
Really?

02:33.260 --> 02:33.700
OK.

02:33.770 --> 02:38.390
Else in this case, a lot of Alsace here, let's say text.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.940
Oh, actually, this has to be start.

02:41.180 --> 02:41.620
Really?

02:41.630 --> 02:47.060
That makes sense, Alison when she started reading.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.180
I'm going to pass an alpha modified because I want to change the way it looks, so it's going to be

02:53.510 --> 03:01.280
zero that six f right to show it, that to show it, that this is disabled now by this point.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.410
And then let's give a color.

03:04.570 --> 03:14.480
It's a color red of the alpha of about 0.5 f floats like this.

03:19.470 --> 03:19.860
All right.

03:19.890 --> 03:23.340
So in any other case here, I'm going to say text.

03:26.100 --> 03:34.320
Right, in this case, we'll know that they have started reading where, say, started on, and we're

03:34.320 --> 03:35.780
going to finish that at some point.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.620
Looks like you have too many things going on.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.300
Let's go like this.

03:42.630 --> 03:43.080
OK.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.820
So we have this have this if.

03:49.730 --> 03:54.530
ALS and to have another if statement here, right?

03:55.670 --> 03:56.390
If book.

03:57.600 --> 04:05.310
That started reading, so I want to check that first put that inside, you like this.

04:05.970 --> 04:06.210
All right.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.340
So man, I'm going to put an else statement there.

04:08.550 --> 04:11.590
Let's walk through this real quick search to make sure you understand.

04:11.610 --> 04:15.360
So what do we want to do is when this start reading is clicked?

04:16.790 --> 04:20.780
First of all, we are going to, first of all, actually this text button.

04:20.900 --> 04:27.110
It's going to either be enabled or disabled depending on the book status, right, if it started reading.

04:27.650 --> 04:31.410
So if books that started reading is known, that means it's true.

04:31.430 --> 04:34.370
So Enable is going to be true, which means it's going to look like this, right?

04:35.210 --> 04:41.150
And then we're going to check real quick inside of this book was going to change this text, depending

04:41.600 --> 04:42.530
on the situation.

04:42.810 --> 04:48.350
OK, so we're going to check if ebook in this case, if started reading the value.

04:49.950 --> 04:54.510
We're going to toggle back and forth, right, so that's why would that instead of a remember, immutable

04:54.510 --> 04:54.870
state?

04:55.710 --> 04:57.320
So in this case, here we started reading.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.180
It's true or it's the opposite.

04:59.190 --> 05:02.390
Whatever it is, we're going to face start reading, right?

05:02.410 --> 05:04.140
So it's going to look like they start reading.

05:04.980 --> 05:09.930
Else is going to say, started reading, meaning we going to change this text to say, started reading

05:09.930 --> 05:14.940
because it would say that you indeed either have clicked to say that they've started reading.

05:15.240 --> 05:22.060
Now this else here is outside the main if from the book started reading coming from our database.

05:22.770 --> 05:29.190
So what we want to do is if books I started reading is not novel, which is going to be catched hot

05:29.190 --> 05:30.240
here in this LS.

05:30.690 --> 05:38.340
What I want to do is we're going to, of course, get the date of when this was started reading why

05:38.340 --> 05:40.230
the date when we started reading this book?

05:41.410 --> 05:50.410
And that's what are we going to add here so we can see text and where they started, then that pass

05:50.410 --> 05:50.860
here?

05:51.070 --> 05:56.080
The book started reading like that.

05:58.150 --> 06:02.590
We will have to format this date later, but we'll get there, so I'm going to do

06:05.920 --> 06:07.270
format date.

06:08.740 --> 06:09.000
Right.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.070
So that's all we're doing here.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.850
Let's go ahead and run just to see what we have there.

06:18.850 --> 06:22.570
OK, let's just pick one, and you can see it is indeed enabled.

06:22.690 --> 06:24.040
And of course, not changing anything.

06:24.040 --> 06:24.400
Why?

06:24.400 --> 06:30.160
Because we need to actually because this tagline here is not happening, because we need to do that

06:30.160 --> 06:36.800
when the buttons text, when the button is clicked on here and which is started reading that value.

06:36.820 --> 06:37.670
First of all, go ahead.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.500
Set true.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.450
When we click on it.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.430
So now if we run again.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.140
I'm going to be able to see that it's going to toggle itself.

06:49.990 --> 06:50.770
OK, let's see.

06:50.830 --> 06:53.880
Click Voila, I started reading again, let's.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.560
Like I said, we don't want to change it back.

06:56.950 --> 07:01.960
Once we start reading it first, we can change that if we want to, but we're just going to leave it

07:01.960 --> 07:02.860
as it is like that.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.140
Let's go ahead and add this second one.

07:05.140 --> 07:10.450
There is going to be the same concept with some minor differences after the Owls.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.780
I put a spacer here.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.430
Say height of about four deep.

07:23.760 --> 07:27.450
In the text button, put it down enabled.

07:28.020 --> 07:32.310
It's going to be depending on book that finished reading.

07:33.510 --> 07:34.410
It's not known.

07:37.940 --> 07:38.300
This.

07:39.870 --> 07:48.750
And then inside, I went to the same thing, go and check if book that finished reading is no, that's

07:48.750 --> 07:50.720
the case, then I'm going to even check further.

07:50.730 --> 07:53.400
So if I'm going to create yet another.

07:54.580 --> 08:00.100
Variable here, immutable variable valve is finished reading.

08:05.050 --> 08:05.860
Remember?

08:11.000 --> 08:15.200
Mutable state of, say, false first, OK.

08:15.800 --> 08:22.700
So we're going to do the same thing, check if it's not finished reading.

08:27.530 --> 08:37.870
If it's not true, then this Kasem's text is going to say what will say, Mark as read, it's just a

08:37.870 --> 08:49.050
normal one else text will say finished reading like this and else, right?

08:49.060 --> 08:51.310
In this case here, grandpa, go to the.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.370
If statement that one.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.620
So I'm going to say else.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.250
Well, the text will say.

09:02.460 --> 09:09.300
Finished reading or finished on and pass in the actual.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.350
Book not finished reading.

09:13.380 --> 09:18.330
And of course, we will come back here to do format like that.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.550
OK, so we're doing the same thing here.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.980
If indeed this is finished.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.090
For course, make sure that no one click here.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.820
We're going to say it's finished reading that value.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.230
We're going to set that to true.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.140
So to drive everything OK again, we are saying is we're going to first check to see if book finished

09:40.140 --> 09:42.750
reading from our database, right?

09:44.000 --> 09:50.050
Finish reading is no is novel in this case, it is novel, and this is true that enables going to be

09:50.060 --> 09:54.380
name, which means they can't actually say Mark as read.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.780
So click and go from there, right?

09:57.200 --> 10:00.410
And then inside here I'm going to check if it's finished.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.650
Reading is not true, then he's going to say Mark as read want them to mark us, right?

10:06.650 --> 10:07.760
Because they haven't finished it.

10:07.790 --> 10:13.340
If they need to say so right, Alice is going to say finish reading because we know that if it's finished,

10:13.340 --> 10:16.250
is it a true, then they finished reading it.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.230
OK, finished reading.

10:18.710 --> 10:21.370
That's going to happen the moment we click it, right?

10:22.220 --> 10:22.820
Wonderful.

10:23.200 --> 10:31.280
Alice, this Alice here is outside for our test here in our book that finished reading If no coming

10:31.280 --> 10:35.220
from our database, if book that finished reading is not novel.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.130
This is where it is going to run, right?

10:37.400 --> 10:42.770
So what I want to do, then we're going to pull in the finished reading date and add it here.

10:43.670 --> 10:48.320
So that when they come back, this is going to be the actual date when they finished something I say

10:48.320 --> 10:49.640
finished on and the date.

10:49.760 --> 10:56.420
Now it's not going to really make a lot of difference visually, but once we have everything set up,

10:56.420 --> 10:57.140
this should work.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.070
Now click.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.900
All right, there we go.

11:01.590 --> 11:02.130
Looking good.

11:03.420 --> 11:08.550
It's finished reading now, it's finished reading that idea is that when you say finished reading,

11:08.550 --> 11:13.890
we can go back and come back, this is going to go and repopulate itself at this point is, are saying

11:13.890 --> 11:19.290
finished reading because it looks at this book that finished finished reading from our book, it's still

11:19.290 --> 11:19.770
no.

11:19.800 --> 11:24.000
So that's why it doesn't even go and read this and added the actual date.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.710
Same with start reading, right?

11:26.490 --> 11:27.810
OK, very good.

11:27.840 --> 11:33.150
So we have this structure here and next we're going to work on the other structures that we need to

11:33.150 --> 11:33.390
add.

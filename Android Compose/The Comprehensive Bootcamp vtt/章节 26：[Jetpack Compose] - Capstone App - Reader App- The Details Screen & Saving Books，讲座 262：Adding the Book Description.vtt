WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:03.510
All right, so next, let's continue here and add the rest.

00:03.970 --> 00:10.110
OK, so after a spacer, we are going to add the description.

00:12.140 --> 00:19.670
Now the description here, if you go, let's go back to our source here, description can be a very

00:19.670 --> 00:23.150
long amount of test text, right?

00:23.480 --> 00:30.350
So what do we need to do is we need to get what we need to make sure that this is inside of a scrollable

00:30.710 --> 00:38.000
view per say, used one four many times, which is the lazy column, so we can use that as a lazy column.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.200
Go ahead.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.940
Let's add a modifier here.

00:44.490 --> 00:49.330
My fire pattern is pretty deep.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.120
All around, I think that's OK.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.040
And then inside and I say, item, just use that lamp right there.

00:56.940 --> 01:03.180
So here again, say text and pass the text, which is going to be the.

01:08.820 --> 01:13.740
Book data, uh, description like this.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.350
OK, let's go ahead and run and just see how things will look.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.480
OK, there we go.

01:28.510 --> 01:29.830
I can see it scrollable.

01:30.310 --> 01:32.380
And life is great, but it's not that great.

01:33.340 --> 01:39.070
No one, you can see that we have these HD metal tags because some of these text come.

01:39.430 --> 01:44.020
Some of this text is being probably passed or scraped from websites.

01:44.210 --> 01:49.720
OK, so we do have that HTML tag those estimable tags there, so we want to clean that up.

01:50.050 --> 01:51.970
Luckily, we do have a way to do so.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.360
So right inside here, let me go ahead and create.

01:56.290 --> 02:02.350
Actually, I would say I would say Val called this clean description.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.090
OK, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to use a call.

02:07.330 --> 02:11.890
HTML compact like this is from Android X core text.

02:12.460 --> 02:18.910
And when you invoke this from HTML in passing to source what is the source can to be book data.

02:19.950 --> 02:27.630
That description, as such, let's say, to string, it looks like we need to pass something there,

02:27.630 --> 02:28.860
just don't wrap that in.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.670
Get rid of that, OK, and then I'm going to pass.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.500
And then here I'm going to pass the flags.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.810
What's that about flags?

02:40.320 --> 02:51.330
Well, I'm going to say HTML compact, say, from mill mode legacy like this and say to string.

02:52.290 --> 02:55.020
OK, so now I can use that clean.

02:56.230 --> 03:05.230
Text inside here, if I run this, you will see that we no longer will see all of these Ishmael tags.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.600
So got a lot of text?

03:08.110 --> 03:08.920
That's wonderful.

03:09.700 --> 03:14.530
But you're not going to be able to see all those tags anymore in any of these.

03:15.330 --> 03:15.820
Let's go ahead.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.510
And this one.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.910
No more tags.

03:19.240 --> 03:19.600
Very good.

03:19.870 --> 03:20.160
All right.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.720
But this looks nothing like what we have here.

03:22.730 --> 03:28.270
So we want to create this little structure here so that we have the scrollable controlled in one place.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.250
So what are we going to do?

03:30.970 --> 03:35.110
Our lazy column here is actually going to be inside the surface.

03:35.470 --> 03:38.590
So I'm going to come here and say, surface, whoops.

03:38.650 --> 03:42.070
Not there outside.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.020
Actually, this could be inside, too.

03:46.250 --> 03:56.200
Well, I'm going to say surface, and let's pass a few things here, modifier, and I'm going to give

03:56.200 --> 03:57.160
it a height.

03:57.850 --> 04:00.880
Now, this height has to be a little bit different.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.920
Looks like I have a different modifier here.

04:02.920 --> 04:07.060
Let's say modifier gold padding, so we get the correct one.

04:07.090 --> 04:07.390
OK?

04:09.250 --> 04:10.100
Pass a height.

04:10.120 --> 04:14.500
So the height we're going to pass here is going to be a little bit different in that we are going to

04:14.500 --> 04:20.470
get the height from our resources display metrics because we want to control this height.

04:20.860 --> 04:28.390
I slide here, I'm going to zero several local dams and I'm going to say local context.

04:31.950 --> 04:32.280
OK.

04:32.340 --> 04:39.720
To get a contest, go to current in court resources, which will know exactly the size of our screen,

04:39.720 --> 04:40.710
all the dimensions.

04:41.070 --> 04:41.340
Right.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.460
And then we see that display metrics.

04:45.150 --> 04:54.240
OK, so then here what I'm going to pass is going to be local dams that height in pixels get a deep

04:54.810 --> 04:56.040
right the unit.

04:56.640 --> 05:02.100
And then I'm going to say multiply that by a multiplier was going to be zero point zero nine.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.140
So I'm going to make it small that way.

05:05.160 --> 05:10.800
This will grow to size depending on the screen size of the device.

05:11.310 --> 05:11.730
There we go.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.950
I had to add the f four float.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.120
OK, there we go.

05:15.130 --> 05:16.110
So that should be good.

05:16.980 --> 05:27.090
I'm going to also say dot padding of about four dpi going to add a shape around it.

05:27.790 --> 05:39.540
Uh, make it this rectangle or right rectangle shape such that I'm going to add a border border stroke

05:40.350 --> 05:43.110
width is going to be about one dpi.

05:44.700 --> 05:45.570
Give a color.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.260
Got a great it's fine.

05:51.030 --> 05:51.480
OK.

05:51.810 --> 05:52.500
Should be good.

05:55.600 --> 06:01.450
OK, so then all of this, I'm going to add, put it all inside there.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.010
OK, let's run this and see.

06:06.370 --> 06:06.670
OK.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.940
OK, looks much better right now.

06:10.960 --> 06:18.860
There's something about this category, I think, I think what I will do for all categories, I may

06:18.860 --> 06:21.070
pass also overflow here.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.410
I'm going to say.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.420
Overflow.

06:30.830 --> 06:37.190
Ellipses and for that to work, of course, we need to pass the max lines for, say, Max.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.210
Give me about three.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.220
OK, I think that's going to help.

06:46.830 --> 06:47.460
Let's run.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.050
Let's go check.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.020
OK.

06:52.140 --> 06:55.860
It looks much better like that, so that we don't have all of that stuff.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.150
All right.

06:57.150 --> 06:57.600
Very good.

06:58.170 --> 07:04.500
So what do you do next is add these two buttons I save and cancel.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.160
Now you may think, Well, how am I going to create a buttons like this?

07:08.190 --> 07:10.710
Well, it's very simple because we've already done this.

07:11.010 --> 07:17.460
OK, so think back to when we were creating this structure here that we have in the beginning right

07:17.910 --> 07:18.270
here.

07:18.330 --> 07:18.870
Remember this?

07:19.710 --> 07:22.320
Yes, that's exactly the same thing.

07:22.680 --> 07:22.980
All right.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.960
Go ahead and do that, and I'll see you next.

WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.380
So let's solve the issue we have here.

00:03.840 --> 00:11.360
Our our card, our circle posÃ© is taking up the entire space in our surface, which is not what we want.

00:12.170 --> 00:18.140
So what we can do actually, and this is going to help us because in the long run, that's what we want

00:18.140 --> 00:22.820
to do in a way because we want to make sure that we have another composable in this case and that a

00:22.820 --> 00:24.350
widget on top here, right?

00:25.100 --> 00:30.260
What we want to do is to wrap our circle inside of another composable.

00:30.810 --> 00:31.120
OK.

00:31.730 --> 00:32.930
So what would that be?

00:32.960 --> 00:35.300
Well, that composable is going to be a column.

00:35.390 --> 00:40.610
We want to be able to have widgets that are from top to bottom that are lined up vertically.

00:40.880 --> 00:47.600
What I can do really here is I'm going to put inside of a column because that's what I need to enter.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.370
And then we're going to get our friend here.

00:52.370 --> 00:58.880
If you just say command shift and arrow up control plus shift plus Arrow app on Windows.

00:59.210 --> 01:06.620
It's going to take this entire line of code inside of column, just like that, if I go ahead and rerun

01:06.620 --> 01:07.430
this real quick.

01:07.970 --> 01:10.070
We'll see that if you changes will happen.

01:10.610 --> 01:15.600
One important change that is and they will go now you can see instead of taking the entire space, it

01:15.630 --> 01:16.430
wouldn't put a column.

01:16.670 --> 01:20.240
It reduces the size to the correct size, which is exactly what we want.

01:20.750 --> 01:21.890
Now we still have a problem here.

01:21.890 --> 01:24.380
We want this button to be in the middle of the screen.

01:25.120 --> 01:30.830
This is going to be in the middle of our surface because this indeed is the outer canvas where everything

01:30.830 --> 01:32.600
is being laid out.

01:33.530 --> 01:39.740
So if you have all over again our column here, you will see it's a composable and we have that modifier.

01:40.100 --> 01:47.450
But most importantly, we can now align things vertically or arrange things vertically, as well as

01:47.450 --> 01:49.760
arranged things horizontally.

01:50.360 --> 01:55.880
This is really helpful because that means we have a lot of control of whatever we put inside of our

01:55.880 --> 01:56.300
column.

01:57.020 --> 02:01.670
So let's go ahead and say I want to still vertically, so say for that.

02:01.820 --> 02:06.290
Wait a second vertical arrangement so I can arrange vertically by passing.

02:07.820 --> 02:08.570
Arrangement.

02:09.730 --> 02:14.530
Like this, I want this to be center, so there are a few options.

02:14.620 --> 02:18.190
There's top the center, there's bottom and so forth.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.680
So we're going to see a center like this.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.710
And let's go ahead and run away quick and we'll see what's going to happen.

02:25.500 --> 02:25.970
Aha!

02:26.010 --> 02:26.820
It is, senator.

02:27.090 --> 02:33.600
Yes, however, however, it was said, firstly, we want this to be center so vertically.

02:33.630 --> 02:34.830
It is indeed in the middle.

02:35.010 --> 02:36.120
If we go top to bottom.

02:36.810 --> 02:40.260
But we also want to horizontally be in the middle.

02:40.530 --> 02:41.250
How do we do this?

02:41.580 --> 02:46.380
Well, we're going to go ahead and say horizontally, let's put a comma there.

02:48.450 --> 02:49.530
I say horizontally.

02:49.980 --> 02:50.880
I said a line.

02:51.240 --> 02:56.580
I want centre horizontally like this if we run this again.

03:01.210 --> 03:05.800
And voila, now the button is indeed in the middle of the screen, which is exactly where we want.

03:07.150 --> 03:12.340
Now, remember, I'm passing inside of my app here, which is being called.

03:14.090 --> 03:21.600
You know, I said content and my app as a composable, we have a surface and inside of the surface.

03:21.690 --> 03:25.200
This is the surface with this color inside of a surface.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.510
We added a column and we made sure that everything or anything that is inside of his column is going

03:30.510 --> 03:35.580
to be vertically arranged center and center or horizontally arranged horizontally.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.170
That's why we get there.

03:38.570 --> 03:38.960
Very good.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.100
And of course, inside of our column, that's where we create the sort of what we call critics circle,

03:43.100 --> 03:46.370
which is indeed this composable here.

03:46.850 --> 03:53.420
And right away, you can see that indeed we have everything in the middle as well because we just previewing.

03:53.630 --> 04:01.570
We've now passed the my app, which contains the surface and we're passing.

04:01.580 --> 04:05.840
There's a column there and then we have and then we're calling the create circle.

04:06.260 --> 04:06.860
And there you have it.

04:07.310 --> 04:08.660
So next, what is or what to do?

04:08.690 --> 04:11.590
Well, next, we want to pass by the top here.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.550
What it can do, actually, it can go straight in.

04:13.580 --> 04:17.960
Put a text right in this text here will say what?

04:18.230 --> 04:20.990
Well, I want this to say hello.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.550
And it's text here.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.900
I can say text.

04:23.990 --> 04:27.050
Now there's another thing to notice.

04:27.170 --> 04:33.350
Very interesting here is that we can actually pass named arguments here, and it's really a good idea

04:33.350 --> 04:38.720
to pass name arguments because especially when we sort of passing a lot of arguments into our composable

04:38.720 --> 04:43.400
here, things get a little bit chaotic if we don't add these named arguments.

04:43.700 --> 04:43.940
OK?

04:44.120 --> 04:44.780
You don't have to.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.000
In fact, you can just go ahead and just say something like this.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.620
Hello, and that still works.

04:48.830 --> 04:56.480
But it's a good idea to always pass the actual argument to name something like this and then pass the

04:56.480 --> 04:58.040
values to data in this case.

04:59.030 --> 05:01.610
So for now, I'm just going to go ahead and say, 100 like this.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.750
Of course it's going to be.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.660
Of course, this is going to be inside of double quotes.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.700
Oops, let's go ahead and refresh.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.010
And there we go.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.950
So it's hard to see, but there it is.

05:15.320 --> 05:21.200
And we have our tap button, which is a button now because we made it clickable and then we have the

05:21.200 --> 05:22.190
text there.

05:23.710 --> 05:28.660
Now, imagine that we want to put some sort of space between this circle and this text.

05:29.170 --> 05:29.860
How do we do this?

05:30.760 --> 05:37.060
Well, there is a specific composable that we can use called spacer like, say, space or like this.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.800
Again, you can pass a modifier.

05:39.310 --> 05:42.100
The modifier in this case could be a few things.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.540
So I'm going to say modifier.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.450
Let's go ahead and just type it all out on fire.

05:46.750 --> 05:53.380
And because I want the height of this modifier and because I want to make sure let's go back this,

05:53.770 --> 05:55.030
let's go back again here.

05:55.420 --> 06:02.920
I want to make sure that the height right between this widget and the next one.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.510
There's some sort of separation.

06:04.510 --> 06:08.410
So the more height I have, the more separation I get.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.080
That's why I can then go see my modifier.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.690
That height.

06:15.450 --> 06:20.580
And give it value, let's say, of very deep.

06:22.380 --> 06:22.950
So refresh.

06:24.300 --> 06:24.990
And they go.

06:25.170 --> 06:28.050
You can see there is that space that we need.

06:28.260 --> 06:35.460
So the more space we give and sort of 100 and see, the greater this number is in our height, the more

06:35.460 --> 06:36.210
space we'll get.

06:36.870 --> 06:40.500
So we have a things set up as we want to look and feel good.

06:40.860 --> 06:47.040
Let's go ahead and run one more time onto our emulator so we can see exactly how all of this transpired.

06:47.340 --> 06:47.760
There we go.

06:47.790 --> 06:50.520
We have our app is working and look, well, good.

06:50.730 --> 06:54.540
But you noticed that the text is really small here.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.980
We want to make this a little bit bigger.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.000
How do we do that?

06:57.540 --> 06:59.690
Well, funny, you ask.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.410
We can go inside of attacks here.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.990
If you have over again instead of a text to remember, this is still a composable function we can pass.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.900
Of course, the text would pass the string.

07:08.910 --> 07:12.060
There it is, but we can also pass other arguments.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.710
That's the beauty, again of compose here.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.290
Of course, we know we have the modifier.

07:18.320 --> 07:23.000
Our good friend, we can pass the color, font, size, font style and so forth.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.190
But you see that the last one we have here is style.

07:26.210 --> 07:29.480
This is more free form way of styling our text.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.130
I'm going to use that so I can show you.

07:31.550 --> 07:39.590
So I'm going to say, comma, I'm going to put style and we can pass a textile type again.

07:39.590 --> 07:42.380
So same textile like this.

07:42.710 --> 07:47.630
And you can see we have textile default in many other we have there.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.500
It's textile.

07:48.740 --> 07:54.920
And you can see if I hit enter in sort of a textile, we can pass all kinds of arguments.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.480
Oh, this is beautiful.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.540
So we can really customize our text to our liking.

07:59.870 --> 08:00.740
Look at all of this.

08:01.700 --> 08:01.970
All right.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.190
So in this case, here I can go and change the color.

08:05.210 --> 08:11.090
I can probably say would enter into your line and see color and set color.

08:11.120 --> 08:16.730
I'm going to use this color here and then I want this to be white.

08:17.930 --> 08:18.470
OK?

08:18.950 --> 08:22.160
And then I can see options space.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.970
And then I can say font size.

08:27.210 --> 08:29.190
Right, or font size and let's say, 19?

08:29.520 --> 08:32.420
And now I'm going to use a different unit, which is as P.

08:32.700 --> 08:37.950
OK, so whenever you want to use font sizes, ESP is the recommended.

08:37.950 --> 08:42.480
So I'm going to say alt or option enter to import SB Library.

08:42.510 --> 08:42.990
There we go.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.880
And now if I run this.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.280
There we go.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.600
It's 100 still small so we can play, let's say, thirty nine.

08:51.930 --> 08:52.740
That's much better.

08:53.100 --> 08:53.370
OK.

08:53.430 --> 08:55.080
Because we just change it.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.060
Style an attribute here.

08:57.060 --> 09:00.240
You notice that we didn't have to run everything to see the changes.

09:00.570 --> 09:01.370
This looks great.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.120
Maybe 30.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.610
Maybe 35 can play with this forever.

09:07.850 --> 09:08.640
OK, so there we go.

09:08.660 --> 09:09.440
It looks real good.

09:09.650 --> 09:13.130
And we can make it bold and say font weight.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.050
Then I have to say font weight and then go get bold.

09:18.380 --> 09:24.470
The other thing I can do, I can start typing bold like this, and the idea will actually give the option

09:24.680 --> 09:25.880
for bold or extra.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.820
But let's say extra bold, because we're feeling extra today.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.470
OK, let's go ahead and run this.

09:32.410 --> 09:32.700
OK.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.220
There it is.

09:33.670 --> 09:36.490
So we were able to put together this user interface.

09:36.670 --> 09:41.650
OK, so it's very simple, but at least, but at least is going to guide us understand how things will

09:41.710 --> 09:42.850
work, how to compose.

09:43.270 --> 09:44.050
No pun intended.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.510
How to compose a nice user interface, as you see here.

09:46.810 --> 09:52.300
Now, obviously, the whole idea is that we want to make sure that when we tap as we tap this button,

09:52.300 --> 09:53.220
we made this a button.

09:53.230 --> 09:53.950
It's just a circle.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.230
We want to increase this number here.

09:56.380 --> 09:56.680
Right.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.510
We'll start zero and go from there.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.300
And that's all going to be doing in the next video.

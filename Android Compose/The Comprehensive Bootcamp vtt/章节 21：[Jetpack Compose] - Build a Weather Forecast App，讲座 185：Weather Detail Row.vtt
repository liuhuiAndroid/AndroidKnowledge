00:01.660 --> 00:04.930
So I hope you were able to put together this structure here.

00:04.960 --> 00:12.130
There are two things, of course, there's this text, which is really easy this week and then we have

00:12.730 --> 00:14.980
a more complex structure here, but not really.

00:14.980 --> 00:18.790
So that is that it will have, of course, a scrollable view.

00:18.910 --> 00:23.200
So a lazy column looks like would be the best candidate.

00:23.200 --> 00:30.310
And then you create, of course, a row write a card that we then have a row with all of this information.

00:31.210 --> 00:38.170
OK, so hope you really stopped took as long as you need to put this together because it's very important

00:38.170 --> 00:40.570
to actually do these exercises when I ask you to do.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.550
OK, let's go ahead and tackle this.

00:43.390 --> 00:49.270
First, we are going to position ourselves, so we are going to add to that, of course, inside of

00:49.930 --> 00:51.160
right below here.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.930
Going to put a text.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.730
They will say.

01:01.900 --> 01:09.820
This week like that, and of course, I'm going to style it a little bit and use topography.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.240
I'm going to use a subtitle for this one.

01:12.370 --> 01:13.180
Subtitle one.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.230
Can have a font weight.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.800
I want this to be bold.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.880
And, Eric, well.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.640
And so next, I'm going to add this structure here, which is, first of all, I'm going to create a

01:28.640 --> 01:33.470
surface because I want to enclose everything if I make this bigger.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.970
You can see that I do have this very nice arch there.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.230
Pass a modifier.

01:45.290 --> 01:50.690
I say, Phil Max Width as well as Phil Mac's height.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.320
And then what I'm going to do.

02:07.610 --> 02:10.040
When add color, background color.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.150
Use hex color here

02:21.750 --> 02:22.320
like that.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.100
OK.

02:24.690 --> 02:29.130
And then, of course, I'm going to pass a shape because I need that nice shape when I use the rounded

02:29.970 --> 02:34.230
corner shape and a size.

02:36.910 --> 02:39.620
About 14 dpi for all of the sites.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.750
All right, very good.

02:41.780 --> 02:44.780
So inside of here, it's where I'm going to pass a lazy column.

02:45.870 --> 02:52.440
Because we get to use that lazy column to show the scroll of view, but most importantly, the lazy

02:52.440 --> 02:56.900
column allows us to actually create as many rows as we want.

02:56.940 --> 03:02.520
As the data source is growing, it doesn't matter because lazy column knows how to recycle those views

03:02.520 --> 03:03.690
and make everything efficient.

03:03.990 --> 03:04.680
Very handy.

03:05.020 --> 03:16.200
It's going to pass a modifier here, say padding or about two deep, and then I'm going to actually

03:16.200 --> 03:17.220
pass the content.

03:21.550 --> 03:23.800
Padding and say padding values.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.620
All around, over one, one over by one.

03:29.010 --> 03:35.160
So what this means is that this pattern is going to be applied to the items inside of of our lazy column.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.030
All right.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.950
And of course, we have a lambda there.

03:38.220 --> 03:39.360
OK, very good.

03:40.050 --> 03:43.370
So for our lazy column, going to pass items, right?

03:43.390 --> 03:49.830
So there's different flavors of this method items I want the one that accepts a list of items in this

03:49.830 --> 03:51.750
case, some items.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.120
Set that to our data, right?

04:00.320 --> 04:03.440
And get to the list, which is going to be a list of weather.

04:04.010 --> 04:04.370
All right.

04:05.090 --> 04:08.930
And then, of course, infrared lambda in this case here I'm going to see.

04:11.950 --> 04:17.710
Item is going to be whether items like this or we can start using them.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.350
So what I'm going to do here for now, I'm just going to put a text so you can see that I'm going to

04:23.350 --> 04:29.680
pass our item, which is going to be whether item object and I'm going to get, let's see.

04:29.680 --> 04:38.530
I want to just go get the temp and the max say to string like this so we can see.

04:41.170 --> 04:48.420
And just like that, you can see we get all of the highs for Istanbul in Fahrenheit, right?

04:48.430 --> 04:55.480
One two three four five six seven So what happens here is that it goes and loops through all of these

04:56.710 --> 05:04.330
forecasts and we are getting, of course, the max for each one of these objects that we have for the

05:04.330 --> 05:05.200
seven day forecast.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.460
OK, very good.

05:07.490 --> 05:13.880
So we know we're getting good data in case we weren't sure, but at least now we know everything is

05:13.880 --> 05:19.300
working fine, so now we can actually work on the the row.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.250
So we want something that looks like this, this structure here.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.060
How do we do that?

05:23.180 --> 05:30.680
Well, this is much easier now because now I can create something like whether Detail Row and I'm going

05:30.680 --> 05:32.990
to pass or whether object.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.520
Say he's equal to weather item like this.

05:41.390 --> 05:43.370
And let's go ahead and create this puppy.

05:44.430 --> 05:49.440
Now, if you look at our weather bureau here, we noticed that we have something that we need to look

05:49.440 --> 05:55.170
into, which is that icon we said before, if you look back, you will notice that for us to be able

05:55.170 --> 05:57.880
to create an icon, we need a an image.

05:57.880 --> 06:02.670
You are out there just copy base and go to our weather.

06:03.150 --> 06:06.030
I'm going to paste there because we're going to be using that.

06:06.420 --> 06:10.620
OK, so let's just change that to weather icon like this.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.540
So it works.

06:13.110 --> 06:20.070
Now what I'm going to do inside here, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to restructure this

06:20.130 --> 06:22.260
structure, create this structure, this rope.

06:23.160 --> 06:23.430
OK.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.190
And as you see here, the moment you look something like this, there's different ways to think of in

06:29.190 --> 06:31.880
terms of how you're going to create such structure.

06:31.890 --> 06:37.500
You can create a card, but I like using surface in this case because I can change it to my liking by

06:37.500 --> 06:38.970
the card would have worked as well.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.860
OK, let's go ahead and look at putting together the surface.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.220
So surface.

06:51.390 --> 06:54.760
And I'm going to say padding for a modifier here.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.070
Looks like it can just say modifier padding.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.010
Three deep.

07:08.490 --> 07:13.280
And then Phil Max with OK.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.920
And next, what I can do.

07:19.880 --> 07:29.270
Let's pass a shape because I need, I say, circle shape and what I want to do also instead of just

07:29.270 --> 07:31.550
having a generic circle shack shape.

07:32.150 --> 07:37.910
And what I want to do also, instead of having a generic circle shape, I'm going to create, I'm going

07:37.910 --> 07:42.900
to customize it even further by saying as follows Dot copy method.

07:42.980 --> 07:49.820
So what this allows us is what this allows us to do is to create a customizable, a customized shape,

07:49.820 --> 07:55.280
which means, as you see, I can change the top start corner size if I want to crop it, if I want to

07:55.280 --> 08:01.250
make it harder, if I want to make it more circular, more curved or more sharp and so forth.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.970
So this is really, really good.

08:03.020 --> 08:11.840
So what I want to do is I want to change the top end corner, passing the corner size right dpi there

08:12.140 --> 08:19.160
and I want to see make it to be six that dpi, which means the top end is going to be here.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.380
So I want it to be a little bit sharper.

08:21.650 --> 08:26.330
Anywhere else is going to be around like you see there, but here I want it to be sharper.

08:27.260 --> 08:28.250
That's what I'm doing there.

08:29.060 --> 08:31.210
How cool is that, right?

08:31.490 --> 08:38.270
And then I'm going to make sure that the color when I just make it color that white like this.

08:44.310 --> 08:49.680
And then I'm going to add a row, why, because all of these are going to be inside of a room.

08:49.770 --> 08:50.910
So I'm going to create that room.

08:52.430 --> 08:58.790
OK, so from my room, when I put him under fire here, I'm going to Max.

09:00.990 --> 09:02.550
Phil, let's see.

09:03.360 --> 09:09.390
Phil, Max, if you type with like this good and then

09:12.810 --> 09:20.700
I'm going to say vertical or alignment on the center vertically and horizontal arrangement.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.010
I want a space in between.

09:23.790 --> 09:27.660
The reason why is because I want to make sure that because we're going, I'm going to have a longer

09:27.660 --> 09:28.110
rule.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.410
So many items, I want to have space in between all of them.

09:32.970 --> 09:33.420
OK.

09:34.970 --> 09:35.450
Very good.

09:36.860 --> 09:42.890
So now I'm going to start constructing the internal items like what's inside of this row?

09:43.790 --> 09:48.040
So the first thing is going to be this what I want to do.

09:48.050 --> 09:52.910
I just want to see Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and so forth the days of the week.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.680
We know that we are able to get that information from our primary date.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.370
Right.

09:58.970 --> 10:00.260
So I'm going to do something here.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.110
First of all, it's all going to be a text.

10:03.590 --> 10:04.040
Correct?

10:04.190 --> 10:04.760
Yes.

10:05.180 --> 10:11.990
So, OK, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to use the format date that we used before and then when

10:11.990 --> 10:16.850
I pass the weather and go get the date for the date.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.050
Right?

10:18.560 --> 10:18.950
Very good.

10:19.700 --> 10:27.140
So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to split right once I get this formatted date, which is going

10:27.140 --> 10:29.570
to look exactly like this.

10:30.740 --> 10:34.040
What I want instead, I want to get just that.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.540
The first part, right?

10:35.960 --> 10:39.710
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to split from where we have the comma.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.950
And just get this first part there.

10:44.600 --> 10:51.800
Oh, look how clever this is, so then I can go like they start split function and pass the Daily Mirror

10:52.310 --> 10:54.440
saying, Where do they split from?

10:54.740 --> 10:59.810
Or by this case, I want to split by the comma.

11:00.380 --> 11:06.980
And then when that's split, what happens is that it will spit out or it will create a list in this

11:06.980 --> 11:11.270
case, and the list will contain this first side index zero.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.390
And the rest is going to be index one.

11:15.020 --> 11:17.510
What I want is whatever it's inside of the list.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.540
In this case, the first item, which is the index zero.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.080
That's why I can go ahead and do something like this.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.810
Just invoke to get index zero.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.800
So now I should only get this Thursday.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.480
From this entire date.

11:36.010 --> 11:36.270
Right.

11:37.500 --> 11:43.830
And while I'm here, I'm going to also do some modifying here using modifier.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.170
I want padding

11:48.390 --> 11:50.800
and start padding.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.090
Let's just give it about five dpi.

11:54.120 --> 11:58.320
Just give some space in the beginning, meaning to pull this in a little bit to the right.

11:59.010 --> 11:59.280
OK.

11:59.340 --> 12:00.510
Let's see if this works.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.510
OK, very good.

12:06.660 --> 12:13.230
So we have our rose, right small, but that will change Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

12:13.230 --> 12:15.750
Monday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

12:17.160 --> 12:23.220
Now what we want to do next is to continue adding these other items there now about.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.740
Let's go ahead and tackle this image.

12:26.070 --> 12:33.990
It's very simple, as you've seen before, all we have to do because we have reused or created pieces

12:34.050 --> 12:35.850
of composable that we can reuse.

12:37.140 --> 12:44.520
All I can do now is right after a text that we just created, I can call the weather image state.

12:47.210 --> 12:53.220
State images such and past the image, you're out, right?

12:55.230 --> 12:59.040
And it will take care of everything now for around this.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.930
Very nice, right?

13:03.020 --> 13:10.610
It's all the way to the right, that's fine, because remember, we're inside of this row and we made

13:10.610 --> 13:15.800
sure that the vertically alignment is center vertically and arrangement spacing between.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.000
That's why it's giving that space.

13:17.030 --> 13:17.480
That's OK.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.500
We will as we add more items inside of our row.

13:21.830 --> 13:29.120
While all of these items widgets, that is, they will reformat themselves and look like this farewell.

13:29.120 --> 13:35.300
So we're making real progress in the next video will continue adding other widgets, as you see here.

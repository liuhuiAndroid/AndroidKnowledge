00:00.180 --> 00:04.740
Well, welcome to this section and the next section, so what are we going to do now is we're going

00:04.740 --> 00:07.780
to start by learning fundamentals of cuddling.

00:07.830 --> 00:12.120
So if you chose to continue on this sections, congratulations, it's wonderful.

00:12.120 --> 00:12.450
It's not.

00:12.450 --> 00:13.440
That's totally fine.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.350
But I'm happy that you're here starting now.

00:16.350 --> 00:22.680
So in these sections, continuing for a few sections, I'm going to assume that you either know very

00:22.680 --> 00:28.410
little of cuddling or programming in general to knowing some programming, some cuddling.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.940
Maybe not so much, right for some of you.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.500
Some of these lectures may be really simplistic, and if that's the case, feel free to gloss over or

00:37.500 --> 00:38.820
even skip those lectures.

00:39.150 --> 00:45.090
So there's no need for you to sit on a lecture that you feel like, OK, I already know what this is

00:45.090 --> 00:47.400
all about, and you don't have to spend time there.

00:47.460 --> 00:52.980
I would rather you to go and find sections or lectures where you feel like, OK, I will learn something

00:52.980 --> 00:53.370
from there.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.960
If you had some experience now, if you a total beginner, I would still recommend you to go through

00:58.050 --> 00:59.040
all of these sections.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.310
All of these lectures of Kotlin weren't really showing you how Kotlin works.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.340
That's what we are going to be doing.

01:05.460 --> 01:11.130
And you are free to do what fits your schedule, what fits your level of knowledge.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.820
OK, now that we are all hopefully on the same page.

01:15.120 --> 01:15.840
Let's get started.

WEBVTT

00:02.720 --> 00:09.230
Now, although this works, that's totally fine, you can see we have our eye bar and has that hideous

00:09.230 --> 00:10.400
color will change that.

00:10.880 --> 00:16.700
But the other thing will notice that we can do is instead of adding in this rose scope here because

00:16.700 --> 00:19.820
we want a little bit more flexibility, there's two ways to do this.

00:20.330 --> 00:24.710
First of all, is that, you know, top up bar, as it is, you can actually pass.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.620
Just like we saw in our main screen.

00:27.620 --> 00:32.360
We saw, you know, a scaffold to have the top bar and it can pass title and so forth.

00:32.750 --> 00:33.950
You can also do the same.

00:34.250 --> 00:39.010
So for our top up bar here, I can actually remove all of this and put inside there.

00:39.020 --> 00:44.300
So what I mean by that is this fall leaf is if you start typing title like these can see we have a way

00:44.300 --> 00:46.700
of passing a title as a parameter.

00:46.940 --> 00:50.540
And indeed, we can pass anything in this case in the form of a lambda.

00:50.690 --> 00:54.050
So in this case, here I can just go ahead and say something like this.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.450
OK, now when that happens, if I'm passing as a parameter, then this is not going to work because

00:59.450 --> 01:03.550
we are already doing that by passing in as a trailing lambda.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.670
So I'm going to cut all of that.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.330
And then and also it means I can't get rid of all of that as well.

01:10.310 --> 01:10.610
OK.

01:10.850 --> 01:15.490
That also means I can also go to actions type actions like this.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.060
You can see we have another row scope like that, which is going to be four actions.

01:20.510 --> 01:24.470
And as you have over a can see, there's other things we can pass as parameters.

01:24.680 --> 01:30.470
We can pass a navigation icon if you want to get past background, color, content, color and so forth.

01:31.200 --> 01:31.520
Right.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.920
So in this case, we wanted to pass navigation.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.200
I convince a navigation icon like that and we pass it along a section.

01:39.410 --> 01:42.650
So this is actually a better way of constructing our top up bar.

01:43.070 --> 01:49.430
And of course, I'm going to pass the background color, and I can say the background color is going

01:49.430 --> 01:51.560
to be something different.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.900
Let's say color.

01:56.820 --> 02:04.560
Transparent like this, and I can continue, I can say, let's say elevation, I can pass the elevation

02:05.160 --> 02:07.260
that we're going to be passing along there.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.460
And there you have it.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.200
So this is way better.

02:10.200 --> 02:15.840
And I like this better because as you see, it's easier to conceptualize and easier for us to see what's

02:15.840 --> 02:16.290
going on.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.040
All right.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.680
So there is a tapas bar, it's for the title, of course.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.900
It can go ahead and pass a text.

02:22.950 --> 02:28.080
In this case, they will say title like we had passed there.

02:29.010 --> 02:29.290
OK.

02:31.740 --> 02:32.790
Let's go ahead and run again.

02:33.510 --> 02:39.390
In fact, now looks like we heading have a problem here because I made sure that our nav controller

02:40.170 --> 02:46.110
needs to be passed around along, I should say, say, nav controller like this?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.750
Oops, nav controller.

02:51.950 --> 02:54.080
OK, let's go ahead and run.

02:55.820 --> 02:56.420
And there we go.

02:56.450 --> 02:59.990
You can see how an empty and it is transparent.

03:00.110 --> 03:00.550
Of course.

03:00.570 --> 03:01.100
Background.

03:01.250 --> 03:08.630
Now one thing I want to do instead because I am treating everything as different as possible.

03:08.960 --> 03:14.060
Notice the reason why we have this elevation to set up to zero as default, but we can change that,

03:14.060 --> 03:14.390
right?

03:14.600 --> 03:21.560
When we call it, that means then for our elevation, they can add, go here and say elevation, and

03:21.560 --> 03:27.860
I want elevation to be five that deep like this in that will change, of course, elevation, as you

03:27.860 --> 03:28.790
will see in a minute here.

03:30.900 --> 03:35.280
OK, can see now the elevation is pretty much like what we have there.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.340
So let's go ahead and look at adding these three action buttons there.

03:41.490 --> 03:47.280
So we know how to do that because we're back to our weather app can see that we have that scaffolding

03:47.280 --> 03:49.800
per se of actions that we can add.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.370
So again, we can pass anything we want here, any composable, really.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.380
It's still a row, which is great.

03:55.740 --> 04:02.070
And in this case, let's go and add something because we know we are customizing this weather app to

04:02.070 --> 04:04.890
work in any screen, really.

04:05.490 --> 04:11.790
We are going to use, for instance, this is main pool in here to check whether we are showing and main.

04:12.030 --> 04:13.500
And then that's the case.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.850
Then we're going to show those buttons.

04:14.970 --> 04:16.200
Otherwise, we're not going to show them.

04:16.650 --> 04:18.960
So to do so, we can put an if statement here.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.320
Someone say if is mean, it's true.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.090
We can just see is mean like that.

04:24.720 --> 04:30.270
If that's true, then I'm going to create in this case here, an icon button.

04:31.110 --> 04:39.790
And for this icon button here inside, I'm going to create an icon like that for image.

04:39.800 --> 04:44.220
I'm going to say icons that can use default.

04:47.180 --> 04:48.260
I'm going to say search.

04:48.560 --> 04:55.110
I'm going to have this nice search icon there, OK, for content.

04:55.130 --> 04:58.490
I'm just going to go and see search icon like this.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.240
And then I'm going to also add another icon button.

05:06.680 --> 05:12.020
Icons get set out rounded and say more vertical.

05:12.260 --> 05:18.380
This will give us this more icon that user will know when click, there's more to show.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.610
Forget, let's go ahead and see if this is going to show anything.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.460
And you can see there it is.

05:26.970 --> 05:29.880
We have those two icons showing there.

05:30.480 --> 05:35.990
Now this is only if Maine is true, right, meaning that we are on the main screen.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.420
We want to show this else in this case here.

05:38.490 --> 05:43.560
All I'm going to do, I'm just going to pass in a box, an empty box, which means, you know, nothing

05:43.560 --> 05:44.520
really will show.

05:44.820 --> 05:45.510
That's fine.

05:46.230 --> 05:51.810
I'm going to go like this, and the next thing we do is, I know when we call this, we're just passing

05:51.810 --> 05:52.890
Helena T here.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.250
However, you notice that we have the weather object, right?

05:56.610 --> 06:01.620
So we can use that to our advantage, which means for our title here, I'm going to use this weather

06:01.620 --> 06:08.640
object and get this city title that we are trying to get the information about the weather for so long.

06:08.640 --> 06:14.370
We say weather go again in, say, City, and I wanted the city name.

06:15.580 --> 06:22.510
And I'm going to append a comma like this and then add a little bit more because they want to be able

06:22.510 --> 06:27.250
to also say the country that you have silly object can get ID a name.

06:27.260 --> 06:32.620
There is coordinates which we don't care about at this point, but we want to get to the countries to

06:32.620 --> 06:33.070
get the.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.110
In this case, the country code.

06:35.470 --> 06:37.300
So we're going to use the same object.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.490
So whether let's see.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.360
Go to City and then get a country like this.

06:47.160 --> 06:53.480
Now if you run this, you will see is going to say Portland, U.S. over there at the top.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.980
Well, Portland, U.S. and I can put some space there.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.800
You can see that very nice space in between.

07:07.270 --> 07:07.580
OK.

07:08.890 --> 07:09.320
Very good.

07:09.340 --> 07:15.850
So it's working now, if we were to run this somewhere else or call these weather app on a different

07:15.850 --> 07:21.730
screen, we can then of course say something like, well, is mean is false.

07:21.760 --> 07:27.040
Which in which case, then what would be called in for ActionScript, which is going to be an empty

07:27.040 --> 07:28.540
box, which means nothing.

07:28.960 --> 07:35.590
None of these will show it makes sense because all of these items, all these icons are these action

07:35.590 --> 07:36.160
icons.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.720
We want to show them only if the users are on main screen.

07:41.290 --> 07:41.950
And what else?

07:41.950 --> 07:42.640
We don't want that.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.220
Now let's look at the navigation icon.

07:45.220 --> 07:50.300
Let's go back to where we are with our app for our navigation icon.

07:50.350 --> 07:55.350
These navigation icons let me show you so you can see what I mean.

07:55.390 --> 07:56.440
So this is what it mean.

07:56.440 --> 08:03.940
So we can add in this case here, depending on where we are, we can add an icon that will represent

08:04.060 --> 08:07.570
a back arrow, depending again on the screen.

08:07.900 --> 08:14.050
So what I'm going to do is we can accommodate that by going to navigation icon.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.400
And of course, we're going to check.

08:15.430 --> 08:20.410
Remember, we're also passing this icon parameter image of a vector, which can be null.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.150
So we're going to check, right?

08:22.150 --> 08:28.720
Because if we are when we call this weather app and we are passing an icon, it means this icon is that

08:28.720 --> 08:32.470
no, which means that this navigation icon needs to be triggered to show something.

08:33.070 --> 08:40.000
So again, let's say, if icon might variable we're passing is not normal.

08:40.250 --> 08:47.290
If that's the case, then we need to add an icon, something say icon and an image vector as such is

08:47.290 --> 08:49.570
going to be the icon we're passing, right?

08:50.470 --> 08:51.520
This icon.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.860
There you can pass a description.

08:57.540 --> 09:03.000
It's looks like I got the wrong icon, let's start over, say icon.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.310
I want that first one there, OK?

09:05.730 --> 09:06.120
Very good.

09:06.570 --> 09:07.710
What a pass icon.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.060
And this is going to where I'm just going to add in all.

09:12.060 --> 09:16.380
That's fine, and I'm going to add a little tint to this icon.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.040
And same material theme

09:22.620 --> 09:30.210
and say on secondary like this and we're passing modifier and I want to make this icon, of course,

09:30.210 --> 09:30.870
clickable.

09:30.990 --> 09:35.010
So I'm going to invoke the clickable function there.

09:35.370 --> 09:40.710
And this case here, when that's clicked, we're going to invoke the on button clicked and then say,

09:40.710 --> 09:43.770
Invoke like it's going to just invoke this button.

09:43.770 --> 09:45.070
Click What is that one?

09:45.090 --> 09:46.740
Well, this is what we added there.

09:46.740 --> 09:54.270
So the idea is that when that happens, we're going to pass it as a callback to whatever we are passing

09:54.270 --> 09:56.400
when we call this navigation icon.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.240
OK.

09:58.410 --> 10:03.750
So if it's to go back or to go up or whatever reason they want to do, then that will be passed along.

10:04.380 --> 10:09.630
To see this in action, I will have to go to Maine because remember, it's all contextual, which means

10:09.630 --> 10:17.520
in our our bar here, I can go ahead and say I can see how over to make sure where is like it's after

10:17.520 --> 10:18.030
title.

10:18.030 --> 10:20.040
So right there.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.180
And let's say icon

10:24.060 --> 10:34.470
when I say equal to an icon with, say, icon default, say arrow back like this because icon is not.

10:34.470 --> 10:40.410
No, that means then this will run and we're going to have something in our navigation icon.

10:41.370 --> 10:44.910
Where do I get that callback right when that's clicked?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.290
I want to be able to do something.

10:46.560 --> 10:54.330
Now, if we go back to our weather app, you could see that on button clicked is the last function or

10:54.330 --> 10:59.070
parameter of function in this case that is called, which means we can use a trailing the lambda.

10:59.580 --> 11:03.170
What that means is that it can just go ahead at the end of weather app.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.980
They can just put trailing lambda like this.

11:05.850 --> 11:07.980
We don't pass anything that means here can stay logged.

11:08.580 --> 11:12.450
In this case, they say, button clicked.

11:14.660 --> 11:20.090
Like that, just put that inside of there, that's good.

11:20.270 --> 11:26.810
So at this point here, if I run this, we're going to see in a back arrow, hopefully a message such

11:26.810 --> 11:28.400
as this, OK?

11:28.430 --> 11:28.880
There it is.

11:28.890 --> 11:30.800
You can see they're not.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.030
They will go click.

11:32.810 --> 11:33.980
Let's go to our Logcat.

11:36.580 --> 11:36.970
There we go.

11:37.300 --> 11:42.340
Looks like our luck had is not really being responsive sometimes happens, what do you need to do is

11:42.340 --> 11:44.620
restart the entire Android Studio, but it's OK.

11:44.620 --> 11:49.460
We can go to run and we can see that the click button also is shown there.

11:49.510 --> 11:53.440
So whenever you locate, it's not working if you go to the Run tab.

11:53.470 --> 11:57.040
Usually you get the same functionality.

11:57.220 --> 11:58.870
Forget it, so it's indeed working.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.610
Obviously, this is not what we want.

12:00.700 --> 12:09.610
I'm just showing you how this would look if we were to actually add that particular add that icon,

12:10.210 --> 12:10.450
right?

12:10.630 --> 12:12.670
So later, we'll see all that in action.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.170
And so what I'm going to do now in on a main screen here, I'm going to say that I don't want this icon

12:17.170 --> 12:18.940
at all because that's not the deal.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.170
I don't want to have an icon there.

12:20.500 --> 12:25.840
So I'm going to run this and we're just going to see Portland U.S. in that one thing I'm also going

12:25.840 --> 12:26.260
to do.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.240
It looks like that is too large.

12:28.450 --> 12:31.300
Let's go back to our weather there.

12:33.180 --> 12:36.360
And change the size of our title.

12:37.110 --> 12:38.580
OK, let's go here.

12:39.930 --> 12:44.760
Let's start by seeing the color two material theme.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.300
Colonies on secondary, that's fine.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.090
And let's give it a style.

12:53.950 --> 13:03.470
I won't fight, wait to be bold, of course, and font size to be about.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.200
15 got SB.

13:14.630 --> 13:15.290
OK, let's see.

13:19.490 --> 13:19.760
All right.

13:19.850 --> 13:20.720
It looks much, much better.

13:20.750 --> 13:21.230
I like that.

13:21.890 --> 13:24.890
So now that we have our app are looking decent.

13:25.430 --> 13:30.620
As you see there, we are going to move on and look at the actual body of our scaffold, right?

13:30.620 --> 13:31.460
So we know.

13:31.850 --> 13:33.830
So now we're going to go and look at all of this.

13:34.010 --> 13:39.800
Of course, we're going to come back when we need and add more or at least restructure everything here.

13:39.810 --> 13:40.420
But that's fine.

13:40.430 --> 13:45.230
At least we have the bases, which is important because we can reuse it as many times as we need.

WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:04.250
All right, so our user interface is starting to look very good.

00:05.630 --> 00:12.230
The next thing we want to do is we know that our movie may have has potential, has a lot of information,

00:13.010 --> 00:15.350
so I'm going to show you something really interesting.

00:15.680 --> 00:21.290
So what I want to do next is to add a little arrow down arrow.

00:21.290 --> 00:26.840
So so when it clicked, it's going to expand this card to show more information.

00:27.500 --> 00:35.810
So down here after these released, they're outside actually has to be outside this row here.

00:36.200 --> 00:45.920
Let's go ahead and add a an icon and say icon like this, and let's use icons.

00:46.290 --> 00:51.740
I want to say field, and I want the keyboard arrow up.

00:54.210 --> 00:59.610
This case narrowed down first, and content is going to be

01:02.370 --> 01:04.560
down Arrow like that.

01:06.510 --> 01:06.800
OK.

01:08.580 --> 01:12.240
And let's go ahead and add put this in a line.

01:13.380 --> 01:15.660
Let's go ahead and add a modifier here.

01:18.690 --> 01:24.900
So modifier and a one size to be about 25 deep.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.350
While I'm here, I'm also going to say that.

01:33.420 --> 01:38.100
And I want this to be also clickable, as you will see, say, clickable like this, OK?

01:38.850 --> 01:45.420
And I'm also going to change the tint color, the color of this to dark gray.

01:45.420 --> 01:45.840
Like this?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.690
OK, let's look at our split code.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.130
Let's refresh.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.020
All right.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.860
That's really, really large.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.620
That means I am not.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.220
See, that's not the right place.

01:58.230 --> 01:58.590
So.

01:59.260 --> 02:03.900
You're right, this has to be kept this out of here.

02:08.180 --> 02:09.640
Right, this I can actually.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.420
We need to be inside of our column.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.780
Just there to refresh.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.960
OK, this needs to be inside here.

02:28.550 --> 02:30.140
OK, just right below there.

02:30.560 --> 02:30.860
OK.

02:32.860 --> 02:37.690
Now, now that we have that arrow, what do we want to do is as follows, we want to make sure that

02:37.690 --> 02:41.570
when this is clicked, we drop or we increase.

02:41.590 --> 02:48.490
In this case, the size we expand the size of this, of this rope so we can see more information.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.970
Now this information is going to be where.

02:50.980 --> 02:55.520
So first of all, let's go up here right after we have a release.

02:55.530 --> 03:01.720
So, so on top of this arrow, we're going to add a column, yet another column, yes, instead of a

03:01.720 --> 03:02.140
column.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.210
All right.

03:03.220 --> 03:06.100
So this is what we're going to have the information that's going to be hidden.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.080
The idea here is very simple.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.960
We want to make sure that, of course, like I said, when this is clicked, we'll have to have a variable

03:13.980 --> 03:18.460
estate right there will know whether this is clicked on right or not.

03:19.330 --> 03:22.420
If it's clicked, if it's on, we're going to show something.

03:22.420 --> 03:23.980
If not, we're going to collapse it.

03:25.390 --> 03:32.860
So what we need is actually, yes, you guessed it, at the top here, we're going to create a foul

03:33.460 --> 03:41.200
called this expanded right, analysts say by use delegation here by remember Mike, that it's going

03:41.200 --> 03:45.010
to be mutable state of, say, false.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.010
First, this is going to be a.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.720
This is going to be.

03:52.790 --> 03:58.730
So it's going to be a Boolean, let's go ahead and see what we can do, right, this has to be mutable

03:58.730 --> 04:04.790
state, not immutable, least mutable state of and false in the beginning.

04:06.460 --> 04:10.420
And let's see if we can go ahead and import of what we need.

04:10.840 --> 04:11.440
And there we go.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.370
So now we have our state here that will control everything.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.590
So where is it going to be called?

04:17.620 --> 04:21.790
Well, we're going to call that instead of the icon one click here clickable.

04:21.790 --> 04:25.540
So I'm going to say here or simply expanded in this case.

04:27.180 --> 04:32.820
It's going to be equal to the opposite, so we're going to toggle it to the expanded of expanded.

04:37.720 --> 04:38.900
Let's change that to VAR.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.700
Yes, because we're changing it, OK, so this is going to allow us to toggle.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.850
So if it's true, then click, it's going to be false.

04:46.390 --> 04:48.790
Click again is going to be true, is going to toggle back and forth.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.460
Like when we click this icon.

04:52.180 --> 04:53.570
So what do we want to show?

04:53.590 --> 05:02.710
I'm going to put a text here real quick, hello there, so we can see this in action, but how do we

05:02.710 --> 05:06.090
then toggle that visibility right?

05:06.100 --> 05:12.670
Because we want this to be visible or expand itself if it's clicked and retract itself?

05:12.970 --> 05:14.860
Also, if it's clicked, if it's false.

05:15.340 --> 05:21.340
So we're going to wrap this inside of this animated visibility.

05:21.730 --> 05:22.140
Look at that.

05:22.150 --> 05:27.490
There is indeed a function or a composable function that is called animated visibility.

05:27.850 --> 05:32.900
And here are going to pass the expanded Boolean state.

05:33.820 --> 05:40.480
So all of this, then when you put that inside a such now you see we have a problem here.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.800
If you have over is going to say this is an experimental animation API.

05:45.970 --> 05:52.700
To solve this, we have to add this ad experimental animation API annotation to with you to Movie Row.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.230
What is this?

05:53.710 --> 05:58.690
Well, as the name imply experimental, that means it's still being worked on.

05:59.080 --> 06:07.030
They're not sure if this is going to be forever in the APIs in the compose APIs for us to use.

06:07.330 --> 06:13.090
But as it is right now, we can't actually use it, but we have to annotate this with an experimental

06:13.090 --> 06:13.660
animation.

06:14.170 --> 06:14.500
OK.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.160
So we're going to annotate that and then we should be good.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.080
Looks like I have a problem.

06:21.370 --> 06:23.620
I see all too often enter again.

06:24.100 --> 06:24.940
And voila!

06:25.210 --> 06:30.160
So whenever you have issues, make sure, especially with remember to make sure to import because there

06:30.160 --> 06:32.710
are a lot of imports that have to happen in order for this work.

06:33.670 --> 06:34.120
All right.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.120
So now let's go ahead and refresh this real quick.

06:37.990 --> 06:38.380
OK.

06:38.650 --> 06:44.140
What I can do instead of actually writing these directly on an emulator, I'm going to start interactive

06:44.140 --> 06:44.590
mode.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.350
So we are able to click and see if this works.

06:50.230 --> 06:50.550
OK.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.810
Let's see if I click this button there.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.910
Well, you see hello there is showing.

06:56.630 --> 06:56.940
Right.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.100
If I click back is going to hide.

06:59.610 --> 07:00.120
Very good.

07:00.210 --> 07:03.260
Just like that, we have this very nice animation now.

07:03.270 --> 07:08.190
The one thing I want to make sure to happen is that this arrow has to change directions, right?

07:08.640 --> 07:13.530
If it's collapsed, when we click, we're going to show whatever we need to show and then we're going

07:13.530 --> 07:15.750
to change the direction to show up.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.380
Right?

07:17.010 --> 07:17.670
How do we do that?

07:17.880 --> 07:20.460
Well, you should know how to do this at this point.

07:20.790 --> 07:21.500
It's very simple.

07:21.510 --> 07:26.100
It's go back to code where we have the icon here.

07:26.580 --> 07:33.240
So instead of image vector here, I can put an if statement in line, if statement here and say if in

07:33.240 --> 07:41.060
this case expanded is true, then the icon is going to be up arrow up, right?

07:41.070 --> 07:50.370
Because we want to make sure to say, Yeah, you can, then the icon is going to be arrow up else the

07:50.370 --> 07:51.600
icon in this case.

07:52.020 --> 07:58.470
When you say icons that field dot keyboard down just like that.

07:59.220 --> 07:59.850
Let's take a look.

08:01.670 --> 08:02.300
So refresh.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.220
OK.

08:05.300 --> 08:05.810
Let's see.

08:06.320 --> 08:06.710
Click.

08:07.010 --> 08:07.520
Voila!

08:08.760 --> 08:12.030
Click and we are toggling back and forth.

08:13.260 --> 08:21.870
The other thing I need to do here, just make sure, is to change the size of the whole card because

08:21.870 --> 08:24.510
as you see here, if you look at our card.

08:26.160 --> 08:32.370
I am I have this fixed height that's not going to help because we want to make sure that the expansion,

08:32.520 --> 08:37.380
if we have a lot of tax that we're going to show, which is actually the case in a second here, we

08:37.380 --> 08:38.720
want it to be dynamic.

08:38.730 --> 08:43.500
Winning the expansion is going to expand it to the max to height that he needs.

08:44.010 --> 08:46.380
So we're going to just coming out the height.

08:47.520 --> 08:47.840
All right.

08:47.850 --> 08:53.520
So now, instead of our animated visibility here, we have a column over the text.

08:53.970 --> 08:56.610
I'm going to add the actual information I want to add.

08:57.450 --> 09:00.090
So here I'm going to get rid of that for a text.

09:00.420 --> 09:05.430
Now you notice here there's two kinds of text functions overload it.

09:05.430 --> 09:07.440
There's a text symbol that we've been using.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.500
There's this other one called annotated string.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.510
So let's use that annotated string.

09:13.380 --> 09:19.080
So for our annotated string, we can actually pass for a text here and let's go to move all of this.

09:19.500 --> 09:26.150
We can pass the build annotation or annotated string lambda as such.

09:26.640 --> 09:33.740
What this allows us to do is to actually change individual strings that we want to show, right?

09:34.410 --> 09:42.840
For instance, if I have a string that says hello, they're OK with annotated string, I can separate

09:42.840 --> 09:44.310
to say this hello here.

09:44.310 --> 09:49.320
I want to have color read and be bold and italic and so forth.

09:49.560 --> 09:56.970
However, this there I can change that to something else to light so we can annotate each string that

09:56.970 --> 09:57.450
we want.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.360
In fact, we can even annotate each character.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.960
Meaning if I want to change this T to a different color, I can do so.

10:04.230 --> 10:06.270
So this gives us more flexibility.

10:06.900 --> 10:07.250
OK?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.920
So we have two paths to build annotated string as such.

10:10.980 --> 10:17.730
So inside here we can then say something like this with style like that and we can pass a style.

10:18.300 --> 10:24.960
So we see here with style take so we can pass it, d style the paragraph and so forth, and we can pass

10:24.960 --> 10:27.600
the block, which is the actual annotated string.

10:27.690 --> 10:28.140
We'll see.

10:28.350 --> 10:34.410
So in this case, and we just pass style in for the style, I'm going to pass a span style so I can

10:34.650 --> 10:39.470
then see for the color of these spam here span.

10:39.480 --> 10:45.000
That is, it's going to be color dot, dark gray like this.

10:46.610 --> 10:52.460
And I can continue, I can say it's the font size is going to be about 13 at SB.

10:53.610 --> 10:53.880
All right.

10:54.840 --> 11:01.560
Let's go ahead and import ESP, and then I also have a block in this with here.

11:02.270 --> 11:06.510
If I have over, I can see we have this annotated string builder.

11:06.630 --> 11:08.430
So now we're building the actual strings.

11:08.430 --> 11:15.270
In this case, I'm going to pin you say append to append to add could be a string could be a char in

11:15.270 --> 11:16.830
this case of text string, right?

11:17.100 --> 11:22.530
So I'm going to say something like this plot and then space.

11:23.460 --> 11:27.840
And then outside here, I'm going to create yet another with style.

11:31.130 --> 11:31.310
Right.

11:32.060 --> 11:38.990
And do the same thing in, say, style span style past the color.

11:42.850 --> 11:46.080
Dark grey, and then I'm going to pass.

11:46.210 --> 11:47.440
Font size

11:50.170 --> 11:51.430
13 SB.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.780
And for this one, also font weight.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.020
I want this to be bold.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.980
Then, of course, in our blog here, I have to pass the actual annotated string.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.130
So I'm going to say I penned in this case, I'm going to say movie and get the plot.

12:11.450 --> 12:15.860
OK, so I'm just changing each part of my text.

12:15.860 --> 12:20.450
So this plot here is going to have this style that we pass.

12:20.960 --> 12:27.100
And then I'm going to put inside of another block here and at the compose function with style.

12:27.110 --> 12:34.220
I passed this style and I append in the trailing lambda in the past movie that plot.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.290
All right, let's go ahead and see real quick.

12:40.850 --> 12:42.710
OK, let's go ahead and click and see.

12:43.190 --> 12:46.160
And while I can see this style is looking, will it good?

12:47.280 --> 12:50.140
I said plot and you see there.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.240
It's looking descent and the animation is working.

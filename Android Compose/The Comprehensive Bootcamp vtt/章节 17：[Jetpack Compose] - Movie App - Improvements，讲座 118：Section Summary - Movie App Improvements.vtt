00:00.390 --> 00:06.120
So we did a lot of work in this section, so what we did was to make some improvements on our movie

00:06.120 --> 00:13.470
app, so we had something like this and would transform into into something that's more elaborate and

00:13.530 --> 00:14.760
visually pleasing.

00:14.790 --> 00:16.140
I hope so.

00:16.620 --> 00:22.800
Along the way, we learned a few new topics, such as how to add to dependencies in our Gradle, this

00:22.800 --> 00:28.830
case adding to dependency, the coil dependency, which is a library that allows us to get images from

00:28.830 --> 00:34.290
the internet easily without having to worry about a hassle, behind getting images from the internet

00:34.290 --> 00:35.820
and load them onto our apps.

00:36.300 --> 00:42.330
We learn how to use it in classes that model after this case, a movie object, and we'll learn how

00:42.330 --> 00:48.900
to structure even further our application, as well as a little bit of animation, such as what to expand

00:48.900 --> 00:50.670
or contract certain view.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.480
Now, hopefully, you can see the full picture how to start from nothing, right?

00:56.490 --> 01:03.060
You just have a piece of data, very rudimentary list of just strings, and then you can and then you

01:03.060 --> 01:08.660
put together a decent UI, decent row, as you can see here with more information and get images and

01:08.790 --> 01:13.980
and navigate to a different screen or different compose wall passing data and so forth.

01:13.990 --> 01:20.010
So these are literally the basis of any application you will ever create, really.

01:20.670 --> 01:25.410
The complexity usually comes with the user interface of things that you want to include, right?

01:25.710 --> 01:33.570
But the basics of an application is getting data and use that data to show something pleasing to the

01:33.570 --> 01:36.030
eye and useful to your users.

01:36.650 --> 01:36.900
OK.

01:37.290 --> 01:40.110
And so you have those basics done at this point.

01:40.110 --> 01:40.380
So.

01:40.620 --> 01:44.100
So I would like you to take this application and think about other things.

01:44.100 --> 01:52.590
You can add it to it or even branch out finding other data points, finding other data sets so that

01:52.590 --> 01:58.380
you can create some sort of hierarchy, such as this write an application that resembles something like

01:58.380 --> 02:00.480
this, and I'll see you next time.

Now, here are a few steps I think you should think about when it comes to inheritance design, right?

00:05.820 --> 00:10.890
So the first thing you need to do, obviously, is to let's say we have this diagram here now of added,

00:10.890 --> 00:14.390
of course, a vehicle as the top superclass, right?

00:15.120 --> 00:21.690
But it doesn't matter, really, because in this case, here we could refine our inheritance tree,

00:21.690 --> 00:22.990
but always be careful.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.510
You shouldn't have a very long tree when it comes to inheritance because that causes all sort of troubles.

00:27.810 --> 00:32.540
It's important to look at three steps whenever you want to design your inheritance.

00:32.580 --> 00:36.810
First, you have to look for objects that have common attributes and behaviors.

00:36.810 --> 00:42.120
So common attributes again, or fields or properties and behaviors or functions, right?

00:42.630 --> 00:46.920
And to have to design a class that represents the common state and behavior.

00:47.050 --> 00:52.140
Third, you have to decide if a subclass needs behaviors in this case, methods implementations.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.650
There are specific to that particular subclass type.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.220
So essentially what we have done right?

00:59.760 --> 01:05.610
If you the whole idea of creating this structure inheritance is to, first of all, look at the bigger

01:05.610 --> 01:12.900
picture and say, OK, what would be one class we can create that will have the basics or the base of

01:12.900 --> 01:17.760
behaviors and properties for the object I'm trying to create?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.400
And then you design in that class, right?

01:20.400 --> 01:22.200
With that state and behaviors that we want.

01:22.350 --> 01:27.660
And then you have to think about, OK, if a subclass will need those behaviors, implementations that

01:27.660 --> 01:29.670
are specific to that particular subclass type.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.690
So something to think about when you want to create an inheritance tree.

WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:04.260
Now, for those of you who are bothered by the fact that this is in the middle here, we can change

00:04.260 --> 00:08.700
it because remember, this is part of our home content, which means we're inside of our column and

00:08.700 --> 00:15.000
we said vertical arrangement here would save space evenly because we're going to have other user interfaces,

00:15.000 --> 00:15.600
pieces there.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.780
But if you want, we can just say, let's change this arrangement here to top like this.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.980
And if we run, we should see this is going to go to work.

00:26.340 --> 00:27.090
It's supposed to.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.320
And there you have it.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.350
Next, let's start putting together these items.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.630
So we have this card that looks really nice.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.750
And you will see then that this card here is used throughout this page throughout the screen, which

00:43.750 --> 00:48.670
means we need to actually create a composable that can be reused anywhere else we want.

00:48.940 --> 00:56.620
OK, now before we move forward, I do realize we have a few things inside of our reader home here that

00:57.070 --> 01:01.150
perhaps this should be taken somewhere else.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.740
For instance, we can move this title section somewhere else right in our components.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.980
Just cut all of this.

01:11.710 --> 01:18.580
Good components and just add it there, which means now we'll have to call it.

01:20.070 --> 01:21.210
Or import it.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.490
Such a good.

01:25.030 --> 01:28.020
Close this down and also.

01:29.450 --> 01:33.890
Our reader, that app here, we could remove that.

01:36.490 --> 01:37.030
And add.

01:38.220 --> 01:40.050
To our component here.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.180
Which means this will also have to happen.

01:47.470 --> 01:52.310
I did so just restructuring a few things here and for now, because we're going to be working and reading

01:52.310 --> 01:53.740
right now that that's fine.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.600
We can also move this away from here.

01:56.600 --> 02:04.880
Our fat content and add to our component looks like in this case, we need to pass important alignment

02:04.880 --> 02:06.770
for this to work inside here.

02:07.790 --> 02:08.240
That's good.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.840
OK, let's go back and import this RFP that.

02:16.340 --> 02:17.960
So now things are a little bit cleaner.

02:18.470 --> 02:23.000
We'll move this reading right now, area as we work on it later.

02:23.390 --> 02:23.690
All right.

02:23.690 --> 02:26.630
So in our column here, this is in our home content.

02:27.200 --> 02:32.720
What we have so far is this, which is great.

02:33.170 --> 02:36.530
Now we want to start working on this card.

02:36.770 --> 02:40.310
So let me create another composable here.

02:40.340 --> 02:44.600
Let's make it preview first and say composable.

02:45.650 --> 02:47.060
And of course, the next function.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.060
Call this list card book card list cards.

02:50.060 --> 02:50.630
Same thing.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.280
Let's call it list card section.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.640
All right, we have to pass a few things.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.580
Of course, the first thing is I'm going to pass the book that we want to show.

02:58.730 --> 02:59.810
So it's going to be a book.

03:00.110 --> 03:06.140
It's going to be our M book like this in form and book for now because we want to test things out as

03:06.140 --> 03:06.680
we go.

03:06.830 --> 03:11.590
Let's go ahead and set it to a book here and book it.

03:12.080 --> 03:20.930
Let's just put gibberish and title running authors me and you.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.000
For the notes.

03:25.870 --> 03:28.740
Let's just say hello, world.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.200
And that should be good for now.

03:32.290 --> 03:38.070
OK, so this is so that way so that we are able to actually use the preview and another one is going

03:38.070 --> 03:39.180
to be on press.

03:40.910 --> 03:42.640
Details, OK.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.800
This all makes sense in a second here, I'm going to pass it string.

03:46.340 --> 03:50.570
It's going to be most likely an idea of some sort and unit like this.

03:51.320 --> 03:56.300
OK, can we just set up two nothing more empty there?

03:56.840 --> 04:01.650
What are we doing here really is that we're passing all the the actual book, right?

04:01.670 --> 04:07.670
Because the idea is that the Liscard will have to have a book object so we can populate with it, right?

04:08.510 --> 04:13.730
But also, most importantly, we want to make sure that when it's clicked, read this card is clicked.

04:13.730 --> 04:20.900
We either want to go to the details about this book or update and so forth, so we want to pass a clickable

04:20.900 --> 04:21.820
event there.

04:22.610 --> 04:28.400
Most importantly, also, we want to pass some sort of ID because we want a way to know what is clicking

04:28.760 --> 04:31.700
and so that we can retrieve information of that book.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.260
What are we going into?

04:33.270 --> 04:34.670
Details or update screen?

04:34.880 --> 04:38.330
All right now, let's construct our view, our card.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.860
So I'm going to say it card right to use a card composable.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.930
And right away, being a past a shape, it was we need a shape, of course, and we say rounded corners.

04:51.410 --> 04:56.000
And I'm going to just say 29 deep and I'm going to give a background color.

04:56.370 --> 04:57.230
I say color.

04:57.440 --> 05:04.340
I'm just going to give a white color, give an elevation of about six deep.

05:07.190 --> 05:08.900
And let's pass a modifier here.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.880
Padding of about also 16 deep around.

05:18.030 --> 05:21.170
I'm going to give a height of about two.

05:22.240 --> 05:29.410
Forty two dpi, this all these numbers, I have thought about them, of course, but it can play around

05:29.410 --> 05:33.130
with it about two or two dpi for the width.

05:34.150 --> 05:38.170
And I also want to make this clickable, of course.

05:38.170 --> 05:44.230
And when this is clickable or clicked, I should say we're going to call it on press details and I'm

05:44.230 --> 05:49.210
going to call the Invoke in this case pass or book that title.

05:50.020 --> 05:50.280
OK.

05:51.190 --> 05:55.610
It looks like we have some issues of go ahead and drop that with either two a string.

05:55.630 --> 05:57.070
Let's just say two string, that's fine.

05:57.430 --> 06:03.250
So right now, it's going split and see if we can see something, hopefully and see there we go.

06:03.260 --> 06:06.610
We have that list card which resembles this.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.640
Now onto the contents of this card.

06:10.030 --> 06:16.500
I'm going to start by adding a column first and I'm going to pass a modifier.

06:16.510 --> 06:23.470
And I'm going to say the width here of this column is going to depend on a few things.

06:23.470 --> 06:31.630
So I'm going to actually make it a little bit more dynamic in that I want the with to be depending on

06:31.630 --> 06:35.200
the items that we are adding inside of this card.

06:35.590 --> 06:35.860
OK.

06:36.400 --> 06:42.730
So for that at the top here, I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to set it to this screen

06:42.730 --> 06:44.440
width for that.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.780
Before I do that, I have to pass a few things.

06:46.780 --> 06:53.140
So first of all, let's go ahead and create a vowel and call this display matrix.

06:53.980 --> 07:00.370
And this is going to be from resources that display metrics.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.490
OK, so what is this about?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.500
Well, first of all, we need to create this resources.

07:05.620 --> 07:11.590
And before we even do that, we need to create the context because we need to get the context class

07:11.590 --> 07:14.470
really of this entire composable.

07:14.470 --> 07:19.690
So it knows exactly everything about the drawing, about the information about this composable.

07:19.690 --> 07:28.300
So I'm going to say for context, when I use the local context provider, will composable local context

07:29.200 --> 07:33.790
can read a bit about it doesn't have much, but it's this provides it provides a context that can be

07:33.790 --> 07:35.270
used by Android application.

07:35.300 --> 07:41.350
So I want to say get the current like this to get current context, and then I'm going to create the

07:41.350 --> 07:46.090
resources, which is going to be through our context that get resources.

07:46.330 --> 07:51.560
So this will get the resources, like I said, for us to get, for instance, the display metrics so

07:51.590 --> 07:53.530
could see here, it's from Android util.

07:53.530 --> 07:55.510
That display metrics are what really does.

07:55.750 --> 07:59.890
It gets the information about where we are displaying our app, right?

07:59.900 --> 08:06.790
So the sizes and so forth internally, we need that for this to say, Wow, now I'm going to get the

08:06.790 --> 08:07.750
screen with.

08:09.910 --> 08:11.190
Such and how do I do that?

08:11.330 --> 08:16.300
I going to use the display metrics and I'm going to say get the width pixels.

08:16.600 --> 08:22.420
So now it's going to get the width of the screen if it's a TV screen is going to get that with if it's

08:22.570 --> 08:27.940
a pixel phone as such is going to get the whole width of the screen internally.

08:28.480 --> 08:28.750
All right.

08:28.810 --> 08:34.150
To get the actual screen width, I'm going to, of course, do this display metrics in this case with

08:34.180 --> 08:43.110
pixels, and I'm going to divide that by display metrics, density of the phone.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.490
That way, I can get the actual screen width.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.360
That's what I need.

08:46.810 --> 08:50.800
So now I can use that screen with what's going to be the true screen width, if you will.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.470
And I'm going to pass in center of a column here.

08:53.560 --> 08:59.650
I'm going to pass screen with that dpi get a dpi unit of it right?

08:59.980 --> 09:07.160
And I'm going to subtract that by spacing, which is also multiplied by two.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.810
And let's go ahead and create this spacing real quick here.

09:09.820 --> 09:15.820
So Val spacing just going to give a 10, but I'm going to use a screen with that was just completed

09:15.820 --> 09:21.280
and I'm going to subtract the product of the spacing, which is 10 and two.

09:21.290 --> 09:21.940
So 20.

09:21.940 --> 09:30.460
So I'm going to have subtract here 20 units and then still here, I'm going to pass a horizontal alignment

09:30.460 --> 09:31.360
to say alignment.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.980
I want it to be at the start, meaning it's going to be to the right.

09:37.020 --> 09:44.040
Right at the beginning, right now, I'm going to pass over Roe because now I'm going to look at this

09:44.040 --> 09:49.770
section and this is a rope because we have an image of a book and then we have this other these two

09:49.770 --> 09:51.210
items here, right?

09:51.570 --> 09:55.680
That means I'm going to have a row and then have column because I have to have these two top to bottom.

09:55.950 --> 09:59.370
So I'm going to pass horizontal arrangement here.

10:00.180 --> 10:07.230
I want to say Arrangement Center and I'm going to add a column I did, I said, which was going to work

10:07.230 --> 10:08.670
on later here.

10:08.670 --> 10:13.920
I'm going to first put together or add an image like this might.

10:14.940 --> 10:21.720
So I'm going to add an image like this, so I'm going to use the image in passing the painter here real

10:21.720 --> 10:22.050
quick.

10:22.680 --> 10:29.580
And because we want to make sure that these images will be coming actually from the URL that we get

10:29.580 --> 10:30.210
from our books.

10:30.570 --> 10:31.740
I'm going to pass here.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.030
I'm going to say something like this.

10:33.570 --> 10:35.200
Well, I don't have the image yet.

10:35.460 --> 10:39.300
Later, I'm going to say something like this book dot and get to the photo.

10:39.630 --> 10:40.170
You're out.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.090
We don't have that yet.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.700
We'll get there.

10:41.850 --> 10:48.390
Now I'm going to pass a photo here, and I will just say, remember because I'm going to be using actually

10:48.660 --> 10:54.660
coil, which is a library used to load images, which makes it much easier and faster, so we don't

10:54.660 --> 10:55.680
have to worry about anything.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.220
So it's called Remember image painter.

10:59.400 --> 11:06.060
This case, I'm going to use the data such and I can pass the URL, which I can get something and add

11:06.060 --> 11:06.330
there.

11:06.720 --> 11:11.310
And let's just for description, I'm going to just say book image.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.440
Now I'll remember image painter here.

11:13.440 --> 11:19.950
You can see that it comes from Croyle Compose, which is a library that we add dependency of.

11:20.550 --> 11:25.290
If we go back to a project, make sure that you have this because otherwise this is not going to work.

11:25.710 --> 11:27.490
You see, we have coil.

11:27.510 --> 11:29.120
I've added coils somewhere.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.140
See this dependency.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.210
It's important to have that.

11:32.220 --> 11:35.190
Otherwise you're not going to see not going to be able to use it.

11:35.520 --> 11:42.720
All right, now this image here, we want to make it modify it, last pass modifier on fire.

11:42.750 --> 11:50.550
And I want the height of this image to be about 140 deep and the width of about 100 dpi.

11:52.180 --> 11:59.350
And I'm going to give it a little patting of about 40 like and I'm going to put a spacer right between

11:59.350 --> 12:03.100
these two, so I'm going to say of about 50 deep.

12:03.520 --> 12:10.750
What we're doing here really is that we've created this structure where the image is going to be.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.880
And we're going to give it a little bit space.

12:13.950 --> 12:14.280
Right.

12:14.310 --> 12:20.550
That's why we put the width of 50 so that we can then have this column, which is going to have these

12:20.550 --> 12:22.830
two items in this column there, right?

12:23.160 --> 12:23.530
Very good.

12:23.550 --> 12:24.690
So we're making progress.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.280
We'll continue next.

00:00.450 --> 00:07.350
So continue here, what we can do also with said that the return type we have for calculate Cat eight

00:07.350 --> 00:11.160
is an oenta type, so we're expecting to receive or return an integer.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.410
So obviously we can return any other type.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.610
This case, I'm going to return a Boolean because we've just talked about it in passing.

00:17.820 --> 00:21.000
Bullying can only hold true or false values, right?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.170
Either true or false.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.370
So I'm going to create a Boolean in this call.

00:24.370 --> 00:27.360
This fun check age I.

00:28.180 --> 00:32.780
In this case, here to check age, we're going to pass the cat age, right?

00:32.790 --> 00:36.020
It's going to be an integer and then we're going to return a billion.

00:36.060 --> 00:39.530
We say, be looking at we have gotten Boolean there.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.430
OK, so now we have a body.

00:41.430 --> 00:45.660
So in this case here, these check age function will return important.

00:45.660 --> 00:52.380
So we're going to pass the cat age already that we have calculated and then return whether this cat

00:52.380 --> 00:53.460
is old or not.

00:53.940 --> 00:58.740
So inside here what I will do, I'm going to say return because we need to return something.

00:58.860 --> 01:05.490
You can see that we even get help to return false or true because this is indeed a billion type, but

01:05.490 --> 01:07.620
we need to check something for see a return.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.600
Well, what is it that we're going to return it?

01:09.630 --> 01:17.400
Well, it will depend if cat age, let's say in this case is greater than 14, then it's going to return.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.190
True else in this case will return false.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.590
That is the default, right?

01:23.220 --> 01:26.490
So now if I go up here, let's go ahead and get rid of this change.

01:26.610 --> 01:36.960
All of this if I say, let's call check cat or check age passing cat age give equal to cat age.

01:37.440 --> 01:43.920
In this case, because this variable here holding to calculate cat age is the same as the argument name

01:43.920 --> 01:44.310
there.

01:44.970 --> 01:46.740
I can actually get rid of that, right?

01:46.800 --> 01:49.440
So just say Cat H like that, that's totally fine.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.100
That works.

01:50.730 --> 01:52.770
So let's go and run and see what's going to happen.

01:53.190 --> 01:53.880
So it's true.

01:53.970 --> 01:54.750
What's happening here?

01:54.780 --> 01:58.500
Well, Cat Age is 12 while we passed 12.

01:58.890 --> 02:02.100
You know, it's going to be 84, I believe, right?

02:02.400 --> 02:03.480
Twelfth time seven.

02:03.780 --> 02:07.580
So 12 07 is 84, 84 is great and 14.

02:07.590 --> 02:08.790
That's why this is true.

02:09.120 --> 02:16.950
If I for some reason, save one and run, it's going to say false because one time seven, right, it's

02:16.950 --> 02:17.550
going to be seven.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.950
Seven is not greater than 14, right?

02:20.040 --> 02:20.790
So there we have it.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.220
Let's put back what we had and then we have it.

02:23.220 --> 02:30.270
So we have created another function that returns a Boolean and we can use it in conjunction with these

02:30.270 --> 02:33.240
calculate cat h and branch out a little bit.

02:33.330 --> 02:39.390
We can even move further to say something like this if check age, pass or cat age.

02:40.020 --> 02:44.790
If it's true and you can do this, you could say if it's equal to true equal like that.

02:45.030 --> 02:50.640
But this is redundant because Caitlin knows that if you just don't say is equal to true, it assumes

02:50.640 --> 02:51.660
that this is true.

02:52.050 --> 02:55.230
So we're saying, if this is true, check Cat Age, it's true.

02:55.230 --> 02:57.630
Returns it true value right there.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.790
In that case, we're going to print something.

03:00.120 --> 03:08.220
Put that inside there instead of a check age, we're going to say this cat is old, I'm going to put

03:08.310 --> 03:12.270
the cat age so we can see like that, OK?

03:12.630 --> 03:17.070
And say else, this cat is young.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.480
And notice I can remove these because there's just one liners in a way.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.740
So we only have one line.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.270
I can just put all of that like this.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.050
This also works.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.120
OK, let's go in, right?

03:27.630 --> 03:30.240
OK, this cat is old, is 84 years old.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.070
Makes sense because we're past 12.

03:32.430 --> 03:39.840
But if I say to see what's going to happen, this cat is young because 14 because 14 is not greater

03:39.960 --> 03:42.090
than 14, that's why this returns false.

03:42.810 --> 03:47.430
If I change this to a greater than or equal like this, I think this is going to change right because

03:47.430 --> 03:49.110
we are including the 14.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.390
So now it says this cat is old.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.220
14.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.210
All right.

03:53.220 --> 04:00.210
So we're able to again create this check age in passing the cat age, which will return a Boolean once

04:00.210 --> 04:01.320
we pass this condition.

04:01.890 --> 04:05.320
Cat H is greater than or equal to 14, right?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.030
It's going to be true.

04:06.180 --> 04:06.960
It's going to be false.

04:07.170 --> 04:14.460
And so we can use that or use these functions in past the correct values and check with if statement.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.740
Obviously, this is less complicated to check age.

04:17.770 --> 04:21.090
We can make this more complicated or more complex.

04:21.090 --> 04:29.520
I should say and do all sort of calculations to yield a true or false value that will be fed somewhere

04:29.640 --> 04:30.540
whenever we call it.

04:31.530 --> 04:31.890
All right.

04:32.170 --> 04:32.550
Very good.

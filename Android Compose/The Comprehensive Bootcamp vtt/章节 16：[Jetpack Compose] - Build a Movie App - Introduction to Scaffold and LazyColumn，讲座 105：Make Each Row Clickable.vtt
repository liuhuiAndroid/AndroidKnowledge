00:01.010 --> 00:03.410
So let's make each one of these rules clickable.

00:03.800 --> 00:11.270
Now you see the growth itself contains a few other items, so we have the image and we have the title.

00:11.930 --> 00:15.920
We can make each one of these either one of these clickable.

00:16.160 --> 00:20.960
But the idea is that we want to make the entire row in this case, the card clickable.

00:22.210 --> 00:23.410
So how do we do this?

00:23.470 --> 00:29.950
Well, so you should know by now that anything that we can put on the screen, we can make it clickable

00:30.220 --> 00:38.020
even though it's at a button, even though it's not a an extended form of a button, composable can

00:38.020 --> 00:39.460
be attached to anything.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.240
So instead of a modifier here, this is a card.

00:44.670 --> 00:51.150
After we've added a height, I can say that click a boy such and in this case, what is that I want

00:51.150 --> 00:55.440
to happen when this card is clickable or it clicked?

00:56.160 --> 01:02.160
Well, the best thing we can think of here is that first we can only pass a some sort of a callback

01:02.160 --> 01:02.790
function.

01:02.970 --> 01:03.330
OK.

01:03.960 --> 01:09.810
Remember, instead of this function, we can pass, you guess another function which can be, call it,

01:09.810 --> 01:15.600
as a trailing lambda because it's the last parameter, which is a function that returns nothing.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.170
What I mean by that here is, I can say on item.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.400
Click like this again.

01:22.410 --> 01:29.760
I can say I want to pass as a parameter strength and I want to return nothing from this.

01:29.850 --> 01:35.250
So I say unit and the moment we do this, you will see, let's just make it quote first.

01:35.250 --> 01:41.070
You'll see that our movie role, if you have over is going to say, well, is expecting this on item,

01:41.070 --> 01:41.550
click.

01:41.910 --> 01:43.860
Now there are two things to take care of this.

01:44.100 --> 01:50.970
As you know, we can just say equal to curly braces like this to say we're just passing nothing as default.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.660
That doesn't mean we are not able to pass this on item and click here.

01:55.680 --> 02:00.150
We can still do that, but it just tells the compiler that it's OK.

02:00.150 --> 02:02.520
If that's not passed, the item clicked.

02:03.000 --> 02:03.240
OK.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.110
But we want to pass it so we know we can actually use the lambda.

02:07.320 --> 02:14.040
And you can see we have this implicit eity variable being thrown here.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.710
So you can actually change this name against a movie.

02:19.800 --> 02:24.750
And then here I can do for now look d and just pass our movie.

02:27.480 --> 02:27.640
OK.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.930
Put that inside of.

02:32.590 --> 02:33.340
Double quotes.

02:33.940 --> 02:34.450
That's fine.

02:36.130 --> 02:38.090
OK, so now what would want?

02:38.330 --> 02:40.010
So now what is it we want to happen?

02:40.040 --> 02:46.850
Well, we want to call instead of clickable whenever we click the roll, the card one to call the on

02:46.850 --> 02:50.270
item click and we need to pass the string.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.230
What string when a pass?

02:51.260 --> 02:54.830
In this case, I'm was going to pass the movie, which is this string here.

02:56.130 --> 03:00.150
So now let's go ahead and run this and let's open.

03:02.130 --> 03:06.390
Logcat, make this debug, OK?

03:06.750 --> 03:07.140
Click.

03:09.120 --> 03:14.700
Clicking each one of these now seem content looks like a lot's happening, and let's try again, because

03:14.700 --> 03:16.140
Harry Potter.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.070
Let's just say tag, so we can get exactly what we want.

03:21.270 --> 03:23.130
OK, let's give it a try again.

03:23.850 --> 03:29.400
Avatar was clicked and you see each showing the movie that was clicked, scroll up.

03:31.080 --> 03:36.060
And there you have it, so of course, you can see that I've added a few more movies.

03:36.330 --> 03:37.590
And you could do the same.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.510
Doesn't really matter, but there you go.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.440
So it's working.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.040
So as we click, we are indeed getting that movie.

03:44.580 --> 03:44.930
OK.

03:45.060 --> 03:49.470
And pass it along so we can show it as you see there.

03:51.140 --> 03:57.980
So with this, we can do all sorts of things we can, for instance, pass this along onto a different.

03:59.220 --> 04:03.390
Function, a different, different composable that could do something else with it.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.650
Some of the things we can do now that we have this handle here of our movie.

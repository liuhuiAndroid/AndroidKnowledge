WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:03.630
All right, so we have a text field there, but we have this hello, hello.

00:03.660 --> 00:04.440
That's not what we want.

00:04.740 --> 00:10.830
Well, what we really want, if you look at any text field in this case here or text is going to be

00:10.830 --> 00:13.650
the value of our text field, there's going to be changing.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.740
OK, so that means then we have to have some sort of state.

00:18.180 --> 00:25.440
So inside of our notes screen still inside here at the top, we're going to create a variable save our

00:25.560 --> 00:26.190
title.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.570
And this is going to be by remember.

00:28.590 --> 00:32.960
Remember, there's two ways to create these kind of states, right?

00:32.970 --> 00:36.330
You could say it's equal and they remember by remember also works.

00:36.690 --> 00:38.160
So I'm going to use my remember at this point.

00:39.510 --> 00:49.680
So in this case, I'm going to say mutable state of in past empty strings like this or empty string.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.470
This tells us then we are expecting a string to be remembered as a dishonorable state.

00:56.940 --> 01:02.520
Right, so we have issues here, the reason why is because we have to import a few things for this to

01:02.520 --> 01:03.600
work something, click here.

01:04.260 --> 01:10.830
Saying import and it will have to do it again because there are other functions that we need to import

01:11.400 --> 01:15.000
or other the old option enter an import again.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.530
OK, so that's the thing.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.900
Whenever you use by, we'll see that we have to import twice.

01:19.200 --> 01:25.650
So if we go and going to the same because we will need another one later uncle description, which in

01:25.650 --> 01:30.860
this case is going to be for this text field, it might as well do it now.

01:30.870 --> 01:31.710
So remember.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.370
Going to be the same thing, but it was state of it's going to be strange.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.230
So we pass empty string like this.

01:38.860 --> 01:39.130
All right.

01:39.130 --> 01:44.260
So now that we have title and description we can instead of passing hello here.

01:44.740 --> 01:46.160
Let's go ahead and pass title.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.340
Guess that is the state we're going to be controlling.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.030
And for a label here, I'm just going to say title, that's fine.

01:52.570 --> 02:00.250
The beauty here is that because we have created this no input text, composable function, we can call

02:00.250 --> 02:01.450
as many times as we need.

02:02.230 --> 02:06.610
In fact, we need to call it a few times, actually just two times in this case.

02:06.610 --> 02:15.220
Now we are going to say the scription right past that state and there is going to be I didn't note.

02:19.040 --> 02:19.360
OK.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.030
There it is.

02:20.330 --> 02:21.440
Let's go ahead and refresh.

02:24.200 --> 02:24.650
Very nice.

02:24.680 --> 02:29.600
Now we can see we have the title and add note text fields.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.510
Now let's go ahead and add the button.

02:33.090 --> 02:33.950
OK, it's very simple.

02:33.950 --> 02:34.490
You can do it.

02:34.790 --> 02:39.890
But again, I'm going to customize our button a little bit in the sense that I also want to be able

02:39.890 --> 02:45.230
to create that button inside of node components here so we can call it whenever we want to call it.

02:45.510 --> 02:49.360
We make as many instances, as many instances as we want and so forth.

02:49.370 --> 02:54.500
So it's a good habit whenever you have pieces of UI that you may want to use again.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.130
It's a good habit to put them in a different file.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.720
That way, you can reuse them.

03:00.110 --> 03:00.410
All right.

03:00.420 --> 03:05.450
So back in our note components, what I'm going to do here, I'm going to create yet another function

03:05.810 --> 03:08.960
composable function that is so act composable.

03:11.450 --> 03:17.030
Call this function and just call this note button as such.

03:17.450 --> 03:21.890
And I'm going to pass a few parameters, of course, so I can customize it.

03:22.820 --> 03:23.890
First, I'm going to pass.

03:23.900 --> 03:31.430
Let's start with a modifier, because that should be the first thing we pass, say modifier such.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.930
Our default, then we have pass text.

03:40.850 --> 03:41.690
On Click.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.390
The term unit.

03:51.020 --> 03:51.710
So nothing.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.470
And I'm going to say enabled.

03:59.680 --> 04:04.330
It's going to be a Boolean, and of course, I'm just going to say it's true as default.

04:06.010 --> 04:06.430
All right.

04:07.390 --> 04:10.480
So now I'm going to create a button inside here.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.320
So for one, click what I want to do.

04:13.390 --> 04:19.090
Of course, when it clicked, are going to call the UN, click that we passed along.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.020
Here's the thing.

04:20.290 --> 04:25.450
If we do, as you see here, that means then we have to see that invoke, right?

04:26.020 --> 04:31.360
So if you don't want to go through that problem, the trouble of doing that, we can just remove the

04:31.360 --> 04:37.090
lambda and say that this now it's going to call this one, click that we're passing.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.020
OK, so different ways of doing the same thing.

04:40.530 --> 04:48.000
All right, so for our button here, we can pass a few other parameters deed or arguments in this case.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.150
OK, so let's go ahead and say shape.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.840
When I had a nice shape, when it's just a circle shape

04:57.630 --> 05:01.380
or add enabled, it's going to be enabled.

05:02.070 --> 05:02.970
What are we passing?

05:03.720 --> 05:05.930
And then let's put modifiers here.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.170
Pass our modifier.

05:08.190 --> 05:08.550
OK.

05:10.680 --> 05:19.230
And then the contents of this is going to be text and I'm going to pass text and again, and because

05:19.230 --> 05:24.180
text and argument name are the same, I can just get rid of that altogether.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.310
And this will work as well.

05:27.000 --> 05:27.350
All right.

05:27.360 --> 05:38.310
So now if we go back to note screen here and and right after our last input text, I can say note button

05:38.580 --> 05:40.560
such and pass the text.

05:42.420 --> 05:48.180
Save the screen and refresh and see there it is.

05:48.270 --> 05:56.160
We have a save button, so you can see that the button is really close to our add note text field.

05:56.610 --> 06:02.520
Well, actually, let's add something a modifier for each one of these because we can't do that.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.140
I won't say modifier.

06:10.520 --> 06:18.400
I say padding and in this case here, and let's put the comma there for a padding here, I'm going to

06:18.400 --> 06:26.170
say I want top to be about nine deep and bottom to be about.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.690
Eight deep like this

06:32.410 --> 06:35.380
can put in one line, but I like Ken's two lines like that.

06:40.950 --> 06:42.510
And it can do the same thing.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.430
Pass this modifier

06:47.550 --> 06:52.790
next one could go and save refresh, right?

06:52.950 --> 06:53.970
It looks much better.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.060
There is some padding around all of these widgets.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.010
All right.

06:58.080 --> 07:02.020
So now what is that we want to do for on tax change?

07:02.040 --> 07:07.830
So the idea is that when we add something here, we want to capture that information, which we are

07:07.920 --> 07:13.650
going to be able to do that because if you look at the top here, we've set up the title and description.

07:14.580 --> 07:19.710
So instead of the first one text change here, this is for our title.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.690
I'm going to put an if statement here.

07:21.820 --> 07:24.840
Now this is not required, but I'm going to show you something really awesome.

07:25.050 --> 07:32.370
So I say if and then I'm want to say it in this case is going to be the text, right?

07:32.760 --> 07:40.290
I'm going to say that all what this does, if you look at it, it's all that function and it says predicate.

07:40.650 --> 07:45.720
What this means, if you have over, it's going to say returns true if all characters match the given

07:45.720 --> 07:46.320
predicate.

07:47.490 --> 07:49.500
What is it that we want to check here?

07:49.860 --> 07:55.710
Well, we want to check in with, first of all, has pass chart here to signify character.

07:56.280 --> 08:02.640
I'm going to go ahead and check if each character, every passing is a ladder.

08:03.300 --> 08:13.530
Look at that or each character is white space like that.

08:14.310 --> 08:17.250
If that is true, then I'm going to say title.

08:19.650 --> 08:26.010
And I say that to the actual information that we are getting because we all know that we have added

08:26.010 --> 08:26.970
the correct text.

08:27.330 --> 08:28.980
We validated that text.

08:29.550 --> 08:35.070
And if you have over, if you don't know what is white space is, it says white space determines whether

08:35.070 --> 08:40.380
a character is a white space, according to the Unicode standards, to return true if the character

08:40.380 --> 08:41.130
is white space.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.620
And so we're going to do the same thing.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.190
For this guy here as well, a few changes.

08:51.170 --> 08:57.170
Sort of title in this case is going to be a description to set it to whatever we're getting from the

08:57.170 --> 08:58.220
user add note.

08:59.060 --> 09:06.120
OK, so now let's go ahead and see if we can run this just to make sure we can see if we can add something.

09:06.170 --> 09:10.400
So I'm going to run again on my device can run on your emulator.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.090
It's fine.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.880
For the first time always takes a little bit of time.

09:14.910 --> 09:16.770
So let's be patient.

09:17.580 --> 09:20.340
And of course, I have this blank screen here.

09:21.150 --> 09:24.960
The reason why I have this blank screen is because I'm not calling this anywhere.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.300
So my main activity, I have nothing here.

09:27.630 --> 09:30.540
So let's go ahead and just call our notes.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.220
Screen like that.

09:35.270 --> 09:41.450
And I think this time, of course, I have to add experimental because I'm using experimental, I'm

09:41.450 --> 09:45.230
going to add it to the class main activity, the top.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.450
OK, let's go ahead and run this time.

09:49.430 --> 09:55.010
Hopefully this time or works will be able to see something and voila, we can see we can add things

09:55.010 --> 09:59.180
now say hello or something similar to that.

09:59.780 --> 10:00.710
And there it is.

10:01.250 --> 10:01.610
OK.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.700
So this is indeed working.

10:04.940 --> 10:10.790
The state of title as well as the state of the description in this case to note both of them are working.

10:11.900 --> 10:12.260
All right.

10:12.650 --> 10:13.940
So what are we going to do next?

10:14.030 --> 10:19.970
Yes, we're going to figure out a way to actually save these notes, at least saving memory and see

10:20.240 --> 10:20.960
how that goes.

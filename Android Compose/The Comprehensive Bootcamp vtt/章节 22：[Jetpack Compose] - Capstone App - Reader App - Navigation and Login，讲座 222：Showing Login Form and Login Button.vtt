00:01.340 --> 00:05.780
So first, let's look at the obvious here, and let's get rid of this issue here, the reason why I

00:05.780 --> 00:11.690
think it's because I didn't put inside of our column the password, so let's go ahead and get all of

00:11.690 --> 00:12.050
this.

00:14.220 --> 00:19.650
And put it all inside the password like this.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.100
Oh, I should say instead of our column that the password?

00:23.280 --> 00:26.130
OK, let's go ahead and see if we can.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.960
Structure, everything, that's very good.

00:33.190 --> 00:42.430
It's good we run this, we should be able to see, hopefully that these should be close to each other.

00:45.240 --> 00:49.140
OK, that looks really, really nice, so pretty much just like what we have here.

00:49.230 --> 00:52.980
Of course, some padding here and there, but it's OK, looks good.

00:53.950 --> 01:00.540
Now, let's go ahead and add this log in button, so we might still be inside of our column there,

01:00.550 --> 01:02.530
so let's go ahead bottom here.

01:02.650 --> 01:08.770
So here we're going to create actually another submit or call a submit button, which is going to be

01:09.310 --> 01:12.310
a rapper composable that we are going to have a button.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.850
And for that, I'm going to pass the actual.

01:16.940 --> 01:20.330
Arguments, OK, subtext I.D. in this case.

01:24.130 --> 01:25.060
I'm going to say if.

01:28.230 --> 01:38.130
Is Create account is true, then the tax is going to be create account else, we're going to change

01:38.130 --> 01:39.030
that to lock in.

01:39.030 --> 01:45.090
So always doing here we'll see in a second is that depending on situation, we are going to change the

01:45.390 --> 01:50.430
text, the title to log in or create account like we'll see that.

01:50.850 --> 01:51.320
All right.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.180
So passing the loading.

01:55.670 --> 02:02.810
This case is going to be loading that same variable and then valid inputs.

02:04.580 --> 02:12.350
Then passed, it rallied, right, which is this reality that we are validating to see if all of the

02:12.350 --> 02:16.850
items we added, all of the text fields, information we added if it's valid.

02:17.390 --> 02:17.660
All right.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.340
Sounds very cryptic, but let's go ahead and created this composable.

02:21.350 --> 02:25.940
So that way we actually can see all in action.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.550
All right, so there we go, we have our composable what's new.

02:33.580 --> 02:37.210
One thing we actually need to pass along here is the on click

02:40.330 --> 02:46.810
function here that we're going to pass along and we're not going to pass anything as a parameter and

02:46.810 --> 02:47.350
say unit.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.540
OK, so what?

02:49.540 --> 02:53.830
We want to happen here, it's just going to create a button and you may ask, why is it?

02:53.830 --> 02:57.400
Didn't I just create a button as it is straight here?

02:57.430 --> 02:58.660
Now that's very possible.

02:58.660 --> 03:04.720
Just like it was possible for us to create all of these passwords inputs directly by adding the outlined

03:05.170 --> 03:06.160
text field, right?

03:06.430 --> 03:11.440
But this gives us a little bit more flexibility because let's say we decided later that we wanted to

03:11.440 --> 03:15.040
create another form, then we'll have to repeat ourselves.

03:15.280 --> 03:20.500
With this, we can just go ahead and call, for instance, the password input or in this case, the

03:20.500 --> 03:24.190
email input and pass different arguments and then we're ready to go.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.210
So then we'll have a very consistent look as well.

03:29.050 --> 03:29.350
OK.

03:29.890 --> 03:33.550
It takes a little bit of time, of course, because you have to code it up, but then you're set up

03:33.970 --> 03:34.540
correctly.

03:35.140 --> 03:41.380
So I really recommend you to think in these terms whenever possible, a rabbit instead of another composable

03:41.380 --> 03:47.830
so Lenny can pass arguments that will modify the actual button in this case or the text field and so

03:47.830 --> 03:48.130
forth.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.030
All right.

03:49.570 --> 03:55.930
OK, so for our own click here, of course, I'm just going to go ahead and pass the on click that is

03:55.930 --> 03:57.550
being passed along there.

03:57.790 --> 03:58.030
OK.

03:58.630 --> 04:01.750
OK, so after this, let's go ahead and add a modifier.

04:08.020 --> 04:14.450
And patting about three deep and Phil Max width, OK?

04:21.560 --> 04:27.290
And then I'm going to pass enabled, I'm going to look at loading.

04:27.500 --> 04:35.450
I did haggling to make sure that we know exactly the state of our tax fields and make sure that we have

04:35.450 --> 04:39.530
this that we can control if this looks enabled or disabled.

04:40.040 --> 04:46.790
OK, so that users cannot actually click on it if there's nothing valid or, I think added in our fields.

04:48.380 --> 04:52.100
So but also we need to pass and the valid inputs.

04:52.910 --> 05:00.320
So this will set out to make sure that we either make this enabled or disabled the button that way,

05:00.320 --> 05:05.030
if it's disabled, like I said, these are users are not going to be able to say, log in.

05:06.400 --> 05:06.700
All right.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.140
All right.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.060
I'm going to ask the shape for this button.

05:10.570 --> 05:16.330
Put a comma there and vice shape or make it a circle shape like that.

05:17.470 --> 05:22.990
So inside I'm going to put an if statement to say if the loading is true, all right.

05:23.020 --> 05:28.870
I'm going to pass a circle progress indicator as such, and it can also has more information for our

05:28.870 --> 05:31.120
progress indicator in the form of modifier.

05:31.600 --> 05:40.650
So my say modifier and I want the size of this loading or circular progress indicator to be about 25

05:40.670 --> 05:42.670
died as such.

05:43.900 --> 05:44.220
OK.

05:44.830 --> 05:52.450
Else, in that case, I'm just going to put a text field or text, I should say, in passing a text

05:52.450 --> 05:58.000
ID, which is going to be maybe the naming is not the best by saying Text City, but that's fine.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.840
What we say here is a string that will give us the text that we are going to add, which is going to

06:04.840 --> 06:07.020
be either log in or create account.

06:07.630 --> 06:11.080
You'll see that all in place pass a modifier, of course.

06:11.230 --> 06:11.920
What's new?

06:13.840 --> 06:19.420
And I'm going to add it padding all of five deep inside of our text around.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.290
Oh, Texas should say.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.270
So right, then you're going to see that error.

06:22.270 --> 06:22.850
Submit here.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.050
You're going to have some issues because we need to pass that on.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.670
Click function there.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.310
Well, because it's the last parameter that is a function that has been passed as a parameter.

06:33.310 --> 06:37.030
We can, you know, use just the lambda search.

06:37.030 --> 06:46.210
So here then inside here, I'm going to call the undone HA and going to pass the email again.

06:47.380 --> 06:57.010
Get the value, and I'm going to trim analyst, pass the password and value and also trim that.

06:58.230 --> 06:58.560
OK.

06:59.610 --> 07:06.060
Depending whether this is is create account, which we'll see later, we're going to change the name

07:06.060 --> 07:11.670
of the button, so it's either going to be create account for our text, the name of the button or logging.

07:12.090 --> 07:16.980
In this case, if you look or create, this great account is false, meaning we're not creating an account.

07:17.430 --> 07:19.170
That's why it looks the way it looks.

07:20.130 --> 07:23.700
That's why we should see log in.

07:24.660 --> 07:24.930
OK.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.830
So when then they click on down here?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.810
Not in this button on Click.

07:31.080 --> 07:31.710
What happens?

07:31.740 --> 07:36.270
Well, we're going to go ahead and invoke the function on Click.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.200
In this case, it's going to be this one down here, which we are passing this information.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.170
So now where we calling this?

07:45.920 --> 07:49.100
This password here, we should see the email and the password.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.970
Once we run this, let's see, that's true.

07:52.990 --> 07:53.530
Let's run.

07:58.320 --> 07:58.870
And there we go.

07:58.890 --> 08:01.020
You can see now the log in.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.800
It's not enabled because nothing has happened yet.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.050
The women they start putting their money say.

08:08.690 --> 08:12.260
How at mi.com and go to the next?

08:13.250 --> 08:13.790
Hello.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.500
The moment we start adding something here?

08:15.530 --> 08:16.280
Notice it is.

08:16.280 --> 08:24.260
It says, OK, something is there, so we can actually start to make this enabled to say, OK, they

08:24.260 --> 08:26.450
can log in if I click on this.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.400
Let's go to our Black Hat.

08:28.970 --> 08:35.180
We're going to see we have indeed the reader screen log in screen pal at Mi.com.

08:35.390 --> 08:40.580
And there is the password that I just added because we were getting that information from our user form.

08:40.590 --> 08:43.280
We have that trailing lambada and we have that info.

08:43.640 --> 08:48.530
This is great because that means here I can do things like create an account and do all the things that

08:48.530 --> 08:50.570
I need in this case, logging in right.

08:51.410 --> 08:52.670
But you get the idea.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.060
All right.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.520
So it is indeed working.

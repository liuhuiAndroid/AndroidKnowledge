00:00.510 --> 00:02.700
One thing you'll notice, among many other things.

00:03.180 --> 00:08.370
No one, we said that we want to change these values so that they resemble percentages, right?

00:08.520 --> 00:09.300
And we'll get there.

00:09.990 --> 00:15.180
But the other thing you see, if you look at the original slider, we see these dividers here, right?

00:15.240 --> 00:21.300
So these were very helpful because it will kind of give the users a visual representation of visual

00:21.330 --> 00:26.740
aid as to the the chunks that they can increment with.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.150
OK.

00:27.780 --> 00:34.290
So what we can do if you have her over on a slider and go first of all, close this down, hover over

00:34.290 --> 00:39.600
on our slider here can see we can also pass as you know, it's a composable can pass values.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.710
We can pass parameters.

00:40.770 --> 00:47.370
In fact, you can see that we can pass here arguments, one of which is range as well as steps.

00:47.460 --> 00:48.690
Let's start with steps.

00:49.500 --> 00:55.110
So make sure it would click inside here close to the first parenthesis.

00:55.590 --> 00:58.900
And then what I'm going to do is put a comma section.

00:59.190 --> 01:03.600
First of all, let's put a modifier because that seems to just make our day

01:06.000 --> 01:10.920
modifier such and I want to give a padding.

01:11.430 --> 01:16.800
In this case, they start padding when I say start right from left to right.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.120
I want to have some sort of indentations and with 16 dpi, that's fine.

01:22.620 --> 01:29.160
And the end padding to the right, on to the left, I'm going to see also 16 dpi.

01:29.250 --> 01:29.550
All right.

01:29.580 --> 01:29.970
There we go.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.260
So what this will do, it will just indent this to the right.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.520
And this to the left, that's what we're doing there.

01:38.560 --> 01:46.360
So let's see what else can we do after automatic fire, we can pass now the steps right to show how

01:46.360 --> 01:52.450
can we limit our entire slider so you can pass an integer here?

01:52.460 --> 01:54.820
For me, I just want past five.

01:54.970 --> 01:58.230
So if you have a over here steps, it will tell you exactly what that means.

01:58.230 --> 02:04.270
So if greater than zero, it specifies the amounts of discrete values evenly distributed between across

02:04.270 --> 02:05.620
the whole value range.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.930
And now let's go ahead and run again.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.590
Slide incrementing, you can stop there and continue like that.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.880
And the other argument can pass if you have over is on file, you change finished.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.780
We're not going to use this, but you can if you want.

02:18.790 --> 02:23.950
What that means is that this is going to be a callback can pass an anonymous function in this case,

02:23.950 --> 02:30.070
a lambda that will be called when we have stopped moving or sliding.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.570
In this case, this light.

02:32.020 --> 02:38.180
OK, so we're not going to use that, but you can experiment with that on valid changed, right?

02:38.210 --> 02:38.910
It's a lambda.

02:38.920 --> 02:45.580
You can just go ahead here and say something like log D, or you can do more calculation to say, OK,

02:45.580 --> 02:50.230
once they've stopped moving, we can retrieve their value and do whatever we want to do.

02:50.850 --> 02:51.130
OK?

02:51.490 --> 02:52.400
We're not going to use that.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.000
I just wanted to show you in a way this comment that out.

02:55.570 --> 02:55.900
All right.

02:56.020 --> 03:03.670
So we have our slider and we have our either on a face, even though we are missing this part here.

03:03.670 --> 03:10.930
But that part is already done and we've done that part and is at the top so we can actually call it.

03:10.990 --> 03:11.560
Let's see.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.150
To make things easier, I'm going to call that.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.560
Our top header.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.640
Right about here, I guess a top

03:25.640 --> 03:26.690
hat like this.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.020
Right side of my bill form.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.380
Let's run and see if that's going to work.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.470
And voila, looks really nice.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.850
The top header, so the whole application started to look like this.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.830
Now we have some little bit minor issues.

03:46.830 --> 03:47.850
Of course we can change that.

03:48.090 --> 03:53.520
You see, the padding is a little bit different, which means what we have here on our top card is a

03:53.520 --> 03:54.480
little bit smaller.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.680
That tells me there is more padding around it so we can change that.

03:59.130 --> 04:05.010
Let's go back to our card or top hat or should say a command.

04:05.970 --> 04:13.170
Click on that or control Class B on windows and we can go to our modifiers and give it perhaps a more.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.620
And give it that padding that we want.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.310
So it can come up here and say that.

04:23.960 --> 04:29.240
General padding of maybe 20 dpi such.

04:31.740 --> 04:32.040
OK.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.090
It looks real nice.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.200
My much better.

04:34.830 --> 04:38.560
Close to what we have here so we can play around with that, maybe that was a little bit too much,

04:38.580 --> 04:40.620
I can say maybe 15.

04:41.860 --> 04:42.580
Just to see.

04:43.530 --> 04:44.580
What changes will see?

04:49.710 --> 04:49.960
OK.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.090
Much better, I think that looks pretty close to what we have here.

04:55.230 --> 04:58.760
So at this point, we're able to put together the user interface, right?

04:58.770 --> 05:02.840
So now they look pretty much the same, at least for what we are going for.

05:03.180 --> 05:04.440
And that's wonderful.

05:04.620 --> 05:10.920
And I hope you're seeing a pattern of what were you doing with compose or do you create little chunks

05:11.280 --> 05:16.950
of the user interface and you can put them together by calling those functions as compose or functions

05:17.130 --> 05:20.610
inside of other compose functions and go from there?

05:20.820 --> 05:21.030
OK?

05:21.420 --> 05:27.180
But the most important thing is to remember that along you have to also have the state OK, because

05:27.180 --> 05:34.440
all of these widgets, all of these composable, they react to the values we passing in form of a state.

05:35.340 --> 05:43.290
So now we're ready to start putting together the logic behind the actual calculations to actually calculate

05:43.290 --> 05:44.910
the tip that we may need to pay.

05:45.420 --> 05:48.120
OK, let's go ahead and get started next.

00:01.030 --> 00:04.360
So ultimately, our splash screen will look like this.

00:04.420 --> 00:05.890
So let's go ahead and construct it.

00:06.790 --> 00:12.070
So let's go and with a splash screen, I can get rid of all of these other files.

00:14.060 --> 00:19.760
For now, at least, so we don't want just to have a text like this, we want something more elaborate.

00:21.610 --> 00:24.280
So I'm going to go ahead and create a surface here.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.880
And pass it on modifier.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.820
Start with a padding modifier padding, let's just start having padding like this can give an all round

00:40.360 --> 00:46.540
modifier or padding of about 15 deep or import deep.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.020
I need to say modifier didn't add the modifier.

00:51.160 --> 00:51.910
All right, there we go.

00:55.450 --> 00:58.570
And then I'm going to say size the whole size.

00:58.960 --> 01:06.060
I want it to be, let's just say, 330 deep.

01:11.490 --> 01:13.230
And then let's go ahead and add.

01:15.390 --> 01:19.770
A shape to our surface because we're trying to create something like that.

01:19.950 --> 01:23.130
OK, so it's a shape.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.120
And I want to circle shape.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.030
Let's give a color and.

01:41.410 --> 01:44.350
It's a color that white such.

01:51.730 --> 01:56.710
And now we are going to add this border around our circle shape.

02:07.590 --> 02:07.940
OK.

02:08.130 --> 02:17.120
So border one on the border stroke, the width is going to be about two dpi.

02:18.490 --> 02:23.970
And the color I see color light gray as such.

02:25.270 --> 02:25.590
OK.

02:25.990 --> 02:29.320
Making good progress here and inside.

02:29.530 --> 02:39.130
Just put this in your line now inside I'm going to add a column inside of our structure here.

02:39.130 --> 02:43.500
Surface first, let's go ahead and also get rid of this redundant qualifier there.

02:44.830 --> 02:50.140
Here, I'm going to put a column and let's also say modifier.

02:53.950 --> 02:56.700
Padding of about one dpi.

02:57.250 --> 02:57.610
OK.

03:02.760 --> 03:08.760
And then I'm going to say horizontal alignment, but you center horizontal eye such.

03:14.010 --> 03:14.880
All right.

03:15.010 --> 03:22.810
And I want a vertical arrangement to say center to be center like this.

03:23.380 --> 03:29.860
And then we have our column scope idea is we are going to add this text in that as well.

03:30.130 --> 03:36.650
And while we're here because we are inside of a composable, we can just go ahead and add the preview.

03:36.670 --> 03:37.480
Real quick here.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.430
And in this case, we're going to have an issue here because we can't have you have over is going to

03:42.430 --> 03:45.640
say preview is going to go to work with nine default parameters.

03:45.910 --> 03:46.180
OK.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.830
So it's OK for now.

03:47.830 --> 03:53.830
I'm just going to go ahead and actually instantiate a new or a nav controller, such in passing the

03:53.830 --> 03:54.710
context.

03:54.730 --> 03:59.980
And I can say local context that current OK, when I'm going to use that, it's just so that we were

03:59.980 --> 04:02.200
able to see something in our preview.

04:03.260 --> 04:07.960
Let's go ahead and wait until it initialize and hopefully it's score will.

04:09.930 --> 04:11.500
Rebuild all of that.

04:12.570 --> 04:12.870
OK.

04:12.910 --> 04:15.150
You can see we have a very large.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.450
Circle there.

04:17.480 --> 04:22.850
That's really good, and there is indeed that very nice border stroke.

04:23.030 --> 04:23.950
That's OK.

04:23.960 --> 04:24.890
It's good, it's looking good.

04:25.490 --> 04:29.770
So now we are going to add the text, which means these two texts here.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.810
Now this is just branding.

04:31.820 --> 04:35.030
Of course, you can put your own text in colors and so forth.

04:35.210 --> 04:36.620
But this is what we have right now.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.140
OK, let's go ahead and add here.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.310
First of all, I'm going to add a logo what I call a logo anyway.

04:43.670 --> 04:52.760
So this is going to be a text and it will say a reader pass style, but I use material theme.

04:54.710 --> 04:58.550
Topography going to give an H3, so a little bit large.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.320
Then let's give a color actually inside there.

05:08.990 --> 05:17.420
I'm going to use colored red and I would say copy to pass the alpha float here, I'm going to just make

05:17.420 --> 05:20.180
it a little bit dimmer switch zero point five half like this.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.990
OK, let's go ahead and refresh will quick.

05:24.750 --> 05:25.670
All right, there you go.

05:25.700 --> 05:30.860
A reader that looks really good or good and then at the bottom, I'm going to put some sort of a spacer

05:30.860 --> 05:37.100
here because we want to give some sort of space between what we have this a reader and what comes next.

05:37.670 --> 05:46.670
So I say modifier to give it the height scales of about 15 dpi and then right after that and add another

05:46.670 --> 05:47.210
text.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.510
And this one will say.

05:54.460 --> 05:55.000
Read

05:59.410 --> 06:07.630
Change yourself very cheesy, but it's OK, and I'm going to actually want to add the.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.290
Double quotes.

06:10.310 --> 06:19.290
So for that, it will have to escape them quite like that and put like that.

06:19.310 --> 06:24.800
So what I'm saying here is that I'm going to escape this coach to be read as actually quotes not just

06:24.800 --> 06:32.260
a string in our texts there careless go ahead and pass a style when use a material theme.

06:33.850 --> 06:40.750
Typography H5 as well, and let's keep a color

06:44.410 --> 06:45.220
light gray.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.490
Such are good to refresh.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.270
OK, that looks good.

06:55.350 --> 06:56.460
Something similar to this.

06:57.180 --> 07:00.630
Now the main idea here is because it's a splash screen.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.610
The idea is that it doesn't stay long.

07:02.640 --> 07:02.940
Right.

07:02.940 --> 07:08.550
So it's going to go and stay up for a few seconds or milliseconds even and then go away.

07:08.850 --> 07:15.390
But as that happens, we want to see that nice animation of perhaps it's growing a little bit and then

07:15.390 --> 07:17.640
contracts right and then goes to the next week.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.490
So that's what we're going to be doing in the next video.

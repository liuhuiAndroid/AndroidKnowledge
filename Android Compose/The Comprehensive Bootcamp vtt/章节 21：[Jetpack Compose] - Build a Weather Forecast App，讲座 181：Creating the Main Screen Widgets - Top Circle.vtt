WEBVTT

00:01.150 --> 00:05.940
All right, so let's go ahead and get started and put together this main screen here.

00:05.970 --> 00:09.540
There's a lot of things, but are we going to start slow as we always do?

00:09.930 --> 00:11.130
Let's start with the top.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.690
I think that's always helpful.

00:13.290 --> 00:13.520
All right.

00:13.530 --> 00:17.070
So we are going to get rid of our weather app bar.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.700
Let's also get rid of that.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.150
Let's focus on main screen.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.690
So back to our main content here.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.910
Instead of just having that, we're going to get rid of that.

00:27.030 --> 00:32.520
That was just for us to do some testing to see if indeed we're getting data, which we are.

00:32.550 --> 00:33.510
So let's move on.

00:34.470 --> 00:34.770
All right.

00:34.770 --> 00:40.530
So I'm going to create a column here first, because everything, as you see here, it's going to be

00:40.920 --> 00:42.200
top to bottom, right?

00:42.210 --> 00:45.810
All of the data, all of the widgets, for the most part, anyway.

00:47.070 --> 00:50.360
And before we move forward here, it's for a column.

00:50.370 --> 00:59.460
I'm going to put a modifier modifier and I'm going to say padding for this modifier for dpi.

01:00.420 --> 01:03.870
And when they fill max with.

01:06.270 --> 01:13.470
I feel the entire width, and then I'm going to make sure that a vertical arrangement is going to be

01:13.470 --> 01:17.300
center, I snatch and horizontal alignment.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.530
I want to be centered horizontally.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.160
That will take care of everything.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.830
We need to make sure that everything is nicely laid out.

01:27.690 --> 01:27.930
All right.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.130
So inside now.

01:31.200 --> 01:39.030
I'm going to put a text to this tax here will have this top part here, which says Monday, November,

01:39.240 --> 01:41.750
so the date essentially, all right.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.100
So for now, they text and give some sort of say November.

01:50.070 --> 01:52.530
29TH, something like this.

01:53.800 --> 01:53.990
OK.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.950
And let's go and execute a style.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.620
Topography, you know, going to make it a caption, so, you know, not too large.

02:07.130 --> 02:08.000
Let's give a color.

02:12.290 --> 02:15.800
They colors and on the secondary as such.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.320
Right, and let's give the font weight.

02:18.920 --> 02:25.430
And I want to say my bold so us time, say my bold like this and let's give it a modifier.

02:26.030 --> 02:32.360
I say modifiers such and I want to padding about six dpi all around.

02:33.310 --> 02:33.410
All right.

02:34.310 --> 02:34.730
Very good.

02:36.230 --> 02:40.190
Now at the bottom there, I'm going to add this, create this structure.

02:40.700 --> 02:46.760
So if you see this structure is a circle and inside we have all of these other structures, other widgets

02:47.090 --> 02:50.170
so we can use different kinds of composable.

02:50.180 --> 02:57.210
But the one that I always like to use is surface because it's a more malleable, easy to customize canvas,

02:57.480 --> 02:58.160
if you will.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.540
OK, so once they surface.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.300
And we're past modifier.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.290
Give you a patting of about four deep,

03:12.830 --> 03:18.760
and I'm going to give a size in overall size of about 200 deep.

03:18.830 --> 03:23.000
It's a size 200 such.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.810
And for that?

03:26.840 --> 03:27.710
Let's see.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.650
Oops, I'm making a mess here.

03:31.400 --> 03:38.000
Let's go like that, and I'm going to say, actually, I'm just going to put it, come on and give a

03:38.000 --> 03:41.360
shape because I want this to be circular as you see it.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.010
Like that so we can pass a shape.

03:44.120 --> 03:44.900
Let me circle.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.510
Shapely, not very good.

03:51.860 --> 03:55.250
And it looks like we need to import size somehow.

03:56.150 --> 04:02.600
And inside you will see that we will need some sort of a column because we have all of these other widgets

04:02.750 --> 04:03.920
lined up vertically.

04:04.340 --> 04:04.640
OK.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.420
So when you put your column?

04:15.130 --> 04:23.200
And I want this to vertically be aligned arrange should say center and.

04:28.250 --> 04:33.780
Horizontally, I want to line this center horizontal horizontally.

04:34.160 --> 04:34.940
I just see.

04:36.380 --> 04:39.170
And then I'm going to add an image here, which we'll get into later.

04:40.010 --> 04:46.670
But before let's go ahead and add a text, so I'm going to add a couple of texts, actually.

04:48.530 --> 04:53.660
So again, we're trying to emulate this or this text in that second one.

04:54.470 --> 05:00.740
So the first one, I'm just going to put something like for like this.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.200
And let's give it a style

05:09.330 --> 05:10.060
typography.

05:10.080 --> 05:20.850
It's going to be a little bit larger, so H-4 and give a font weight of extra bold like that.

05:23.300 --> 05:23.530
OK.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.590
And this one.

05:29.200 --> 05:35.200
It's going to be a description image as a snow for now, we're going to add the actual text later say

05:35.200 --> 05:40.820
font style, say font italic.

05:40.870 --> 05:41.590
That's what I want.

05:45.060 --> 05:49.110
All right, let's go ahead and give it a rain and let's go ahead and give it a quick run.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.430
OK, there we go.

06:01.460 --> 06:09.010
We have at the top there's November 29th and 56 snow and so forth, so it looks kind of like this.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.680
We're missing a few things, of course, but we're getting there now.

06:12.890 --> 06:13.820
We need to.

06:13.850 --> 06:18.020
Obviously, there is that circle there, but we have don't have that background.

06:18.020 --> 06:22.040
So we need to add the background color holidays so we can see it.

06:23.970 --> 06:25.410
All right, so after our shape.

06:27.500 --> 06:36.410
I'm going to say color, and in this case, I'm going to use constructing actual color with hacks like

06:36.410 --> 06:46.160
this, and I'm going to say zero x f f f f c for zero zero.

06:46.190 --> 06:49.280
Now I know these colors, of course, because I've created them before.

06:49.580 --> 06:56.030
But what one thing I do is whenever we want to add color and you don't know the Colorado was trying

06:56.030 --> 06:57.200
to test things out.

06:57.560 --> 07:03.950
You can just put any gibberish or not gibberish, but a an actual hex color.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.550
And then you can see the got it here, you can click and this tool.

07:08.670 --> 07:12.870
Opens up here, or you can actually start choosing around the color that you want.

07:12.930 --> 07:16.590
So it's really handy, especially when you're trying to figure out what colors you want.

07:17.040 --> 07:17.370
All right.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.020
So this is the one we're going to use.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.700
And let's go ahead and run and see if indeed we're going to see.

07:23.940 --> 07:24.780
What are we looking for?

07:28.610 --> 07:29.390
OK, there we go.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.450
We have our circle looks really nice, just like that.

07:33.290 --> 07:33.830
All right.

07:34.250 --> 07:34.670
Very good.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.810
So the next thing we want to do, of course, is to get the image.

07:37.820 --> 07:42.830
So something like this now, it's not going to be a general image, it's going to be an image that we're

07:42.830 --> 07:46.940
going to be getting indeed from our API.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.410
Now where is that image?

07:48.410 --> 07:50.540
Because you look at here, you don't see an image.

07:50.930 --> 07:53.210
However, you see certain clouds.

07:53.660 --> 07:56.900
If you go to the weather array here, there's an object.

07:56.900 --> 08:01.850
This object has the main in description or description of the weather that day.

08:02.210 --> 08:05.600
And there there is this icon and is a code.

08:06.230 --> 08:13.850
Now we can use that code to create or to retrieve an image, and that is actually somewhere else.

08:14.390 --> 08:18.530
So you can use this code and paste into a URL, right?

08:18.890 --> 08:20.330
And then we're going to get an image.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.170
Now, where is that?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.010
Well, let's go.

08:22.490 --> 08:32.150
If you go to this link, open weather map there or image and and let's say 10 D, for instance.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.090
That P and G hit enter.

08:39.160 --> 08:42.880
And you can see we get an icon image, it's very small.

08:43.210 --> 08:45.790
It's hard to see, but it's there.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.800
So this is what we're going to be using, right?

08:48.070 --> 08:55.900
So the idea is we are going to create another composable with this, of course, with this URL and we're

08:55.900 --> 08:57.880
going to just pass these codes.

08:58.090 --> 09:03.280
We're going to append these codes 10d and so forth to pass that along.

09:03.820 --> 09:04.120
Right.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.910
All these codes, of course, we're going to get from our API.

09:07.390 --> 09:10.270
We're going to pass that along and get that image.

09:11.020 --> 09:19.000
So for image here, I'm just going to invoke a different composable we haven't created called this whether

09:20.410 --> 09:28.360
state image like this and going to patch, we are going to pass an image your al, which we're going

09:28.360 --> 09:31.030
to get from image.

09:32.650 --> 09:36.260
URL, let's go ahead and create this imagery out at the top here.

09:45.130 --> 09:49.080
This and we understand we need to have panned a few things here.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.150
The first thing we're going to hand is going to be.

09:53.290 --> 09:59.740
The actual image, but then I'm going to say that the energy, so here, I'm going to hand that code.

10:00.340 --> 10:02.740
Where do we get that code for our image?

10:02.920 --> 10:08.080
We can see the code for images inside of a weather and inside of this object.

10:08.170 --> 10:13.510
As I said before, and we're going to go to Icon, so we need to get that code so that again, we can

10:13.510 --> 10:20.200
append that inside there and that eight and then that pkg to get that correct image.

10:21.650 --> 10:25.220
All right, so well, how do we get that?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.810
Well, we have our data here.

10:26.840 --> 10:33.860
It's a weather object, which is convenient when, say, data and let's go ahead to.

10:35.140 --> 10:41.740
I want to list in what I'm going to do because is a list which means contains indices, right?

10:41.770 --> 10:47.560
It's a list containing objects of whether in this case forecast whether I'm going to just go ahead and

10:47.560 --> 10:52.780
focus on getting the first item, the first list or index.

10:52.780 --> 10:58.540
That is so in this case, I'm going to go ahead and get this first one there because this is going to

10:58.540 --> 10:59.210
be today.

10:59.590 --> 10:59.920
Right?

11:00.640 --> 11:04.120
And I'm going to peruse through it weather and get the icon.

11:05.610 --> 11:06.000
All right.

11:06.840 --> 11:14.970
OK, so I get to the first object for today, data or weather, and then I'm going to go and get weather

11:15.210 --> 11:19.050
and it's indeed a list or rain, but I also get the first.

11:19.080 --> 11:26.370
It's also another list or race, or I'm going to get the first index item there, which is going to

11:26.370 --> 11:27.370
be this object here.

11:27.370 --> 11:28.950
There's only one, right?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.540
And then I'm going to get the icon.

11:31.860 --> 11:32.160
All right.

11:32.160 --> 11:37.020
So right zero there, and then I'm going to go ahead and see icon like that.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.580
And I'm going to paint the pudgy looks like it isn't like God.

11:41.730 --> 11:42.280
It's OK.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.230
Remove unnecessary.

11:43.290 --> 11:43.650
Very good.

11:44.160 --> 11:44.570
So there we go.

11:44.580 --> 11:52.050
So we have the image URL, which will be called inside of her image, whether state image, which we

11:52.050 --> 11:52.800
haven't created.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.570
OK, but I'm going to create that.

11:55.770 --> 12:01.080
So this composable, of course, takes in that string URL to show the image.

12:01.380 --> 12:07.260
The reason why we are breaking things down is because we may want to use this, whether state image

12:07.740 --> 12:09.390
again and somewhere else.

12:09.420 --> 12:13.320
So putting it this way, it's way better than hard coding everything.

12:13.830 --> 12:16.530
So in this case, I'm going to just use image like this now.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.490
We have to be careful.

12:17.730 --> 12:24.600
We're going to use the image for coil because remember, it's an image coming from a URL, which means

12:24.600 --> 12:25.500
coming from an internet.

12:25.830 --> 12:33.150
So it's much easier using a coil library dependency, which deals with all of other things that we don't

12:33.150 --> 12:36.330
want to deal with when it comes to getting images from the internet.

12:36.660 --> 12:42.280
Image painter like that in the here, I'm going to say, remember image painter?

12:42.330 --> 12:43.170
This is important.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.400
And that's why we passed the request, which is going to be our image.

12:47.400 --> 12:53.410
You l d URL in this case or description icon image.

12:55.020 --> 12:57.000
It looks like it doesn't like this.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.980
That's just not at the request, just past the imagery like that.

13:00.990 --> 13:01.290
OK?

13:01.320 --> 13:05.940
It's much better because that was a an argument that it wasn't be recognized.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.860
So just remove that just past imagery.

13:08.940 --> 13:15.590
OK, and then I'm going to pass a modifier here or quick to modify the sizes.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.430
So modifier size.

13:17.670 --> 13:22.310
I'm going to make this about ADP, OK?

13:23.310 --> 13:30.840
So this whether state image now has been called there, we passed the image URL and of course, coil.

13:30.900 --> 13:35.640
You now know this quarrel because if you hover over, you can see you can do it again.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.050
You can see it says from Io Coil.

13:40.530 --> 13:46.620
Katie, this is very important because it deals with everything in the background to get an image to

13:46.620 --> 13:46.920
show.

13:48.210 --> 13:49.410
All right, let's see if this works.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.370
Let's go ahead and run.

13:52.080 --> 13:58.540
Well, doesn't look like the image is showing maybe there's a space in here, perhaps.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.340
Let's see.

14:00.420 --> 14:00.870
There we go.

14:00.990 --> 14:02.670
So that was a little space there.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.830
Don't add spaces because as you know, that creates issues.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.340
And there we go, there is that image.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.340
All right, this icon very well.

14:11.490 --> 14:18.210
So again, like I said, we can always use the weather state anywhere we want, and then we passed the

14:18.210 --> 14:19.770
URL and life is good.

14:20.640 --> 14:27.330
And as you see, we have that image and that is, of course, dynamic depending on the state or in this

14:27.330 --> 14:30.790
case, depending on the city.

14:31.020 --> 14:31.320
Right.

14:31.650 --> 14:37.590
It should change if I come up here and see Moscow, for instance, let's go ahead and run.

14:38.820 --> 14:43.800
Hopefully, we should see something different unless in Moscow, the conditions are the same as Portland.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.780
That could happen, but I doubt it.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.870
And while I can see in my school is indeed snowing.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.220
All right.

14:55.310 --> 14:55.760
Very good.

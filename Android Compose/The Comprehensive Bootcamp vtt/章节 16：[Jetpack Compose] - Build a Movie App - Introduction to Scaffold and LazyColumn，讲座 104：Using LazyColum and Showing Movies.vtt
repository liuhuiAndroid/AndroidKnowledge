WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:03.620
OK, so we have our skeleton set up here to scaffold.

00:04.060 --> 00:08.940
Let's see, we want to show a list of movies.

00:09.330 --> 00:09.630
All right.

00:10.110 --> 00:10.830
How do we do that?

00:11.280 --> 00:18.720
Now, if you've done Android development before, you probably had to look at recycler fuel cycle view

00:19.110 --> 00:24.810
is a widget that allows us to add lists into our application, right?

00:24.900 --> 00:31.650
Scrollable lists and of course, in Android, in traditional Android development that requires adapters

00:31.980 --> 00:35.460
and requires XML files to create the rows.

00:35.460 --> 00:41.100
And there is a lot of moving parts, a lot of different things that you have to do in order to get a

00:41.100 --> 00:42.480
list showing items.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.900
But in composable, things are a little bit different.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.270
In fact, there are a whole lot different.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.360
And to create a list to create a recycle view in this case, we use a.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.420
Function, a composable function called lazy column.

01:00.200 --> 01:05.300
So let's see how that would work if we go back to our main content here.

01:06.020 --> 01:08.510
Let me for now, let me just get rid of all of this.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.340
We probably won't need that.

01:10.670 --> 01:16.460
Let's just have text and I'm going to pass as a parameter here.

01:16.490 --> 01:16.850
Let's go.

01:17.030 --> 01:25.070
Pass it movie list as such, and it's going to be a list containing strings for now.

01:25.190 --> 01:25.580
OK.

01:26.060 --> 01:30.740
And this list, I said, is to list of perhaps a few elements here.

01:31.460 --> 01:34.100
And first is going to be Avatar.

01:35.690 --> 01:36.350
How about life?

01:36.420 --> 01:38.900
I'm sure there are a lot of movies titled Life.

01:39.290 --> 01:43.910
OK, so we have we're passing here a list, right as a parameter.

01:44.480 --> 01:50.660
And inside here, we want to create a structure that will allow us to create a list, a scrollable list

01:51.170 --> 01:52.520
of each one of these movies.

01:52.850 --> 01:58.400
So a modifier here, I'm just going to say padding give about, well, that deep.

01:58.910 --> 02:05.930
OK, so now inside of our column here, I'm going to call the lazy column function there composable.

02:06.260 --> 02:06.560
OK.

02:07.730 --> 02:13.220
And so in this case, here for the content, I'm just going to go ahead and pass in a trailing lambda.

02:13.670 --> 02:16.280
And I'm going to see items now.

02:16.280 --> 02:20.660
There are different methods we can call here or this item lambda.

02:21.050 --> 02:22.160
There's item account.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.990
We can pass each count if you want.

02:24.380 --> 02:31.700
And I want this either one of these items, which allows us to pass a list of type T in this case could

02:31.700 --> 02:34.220
be anything or array of type T.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.630
I can also pass indexed items indexed and so forth.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.360
So we have a lot of methods and functions we can use.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.700
Let's use the items like that one.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.120
Here, I'm going to pass items for our items.

02:48.790 --> 02:54.580
I'm going to pass out a movie list and then it's a laugh, and then we have a to here.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.100
Here is where we can then for each item that we are getting here on our list.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.380
We can then call it, show it.

03:05.830 --> 03:12.700
In this case, we're just going to put a text in to say it because we have this implicit variable that

03:12.700 --> 03:14.270
is being passed there, which is it.

03:14.860 --> 03:19.000
In this case, the string, because it knows items, is a list of strings.

03:20.630 --> 03:23.870
Now, if I refresh this, we should see.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.450
And they have it.

03:26.930 --> 03:29.750
We have a list of strings.

03:30.230 --> 03:33.110
So does it matter how many other items we add here?

03:34.010 --> 03:36.950
If we refresh, you can see the list will keep growing.

03:37.610 --> 03:38.600
So this looks great.

03:38.660 --> 03:44.750
Now, if we were to run this on our emulator or on our device, we wouldn't really see the power that

03:44.750 --> 03:50.390
we have here because we don't have as many items as we could have, so we wouldn't see this scrollable

03:50.390 --> 03:51.440
effect happening.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.050
But let's modify things here.

03:54.050 --> 03:58.550
First of all, this is really boring with just passing text, creating a list of text, which is fine

03:58.550 --> 03:59.120
in some cases.

03:59.120 --> 04:06.230
But in this case, we can create some sort of a role that will represent each one of these items, each

04:06.230 --> 04:07.040
one of these movies.

04:07.610 --> 04:15.230
We can wrap this inside of yet another composable and we can structure what we want to see.

04:15.650 --> 04:16.700
So what we can do?

04:17.450 --> 04:18.650
Yes, you guessed it.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.270
I'm going to create another composable at the bottom here.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.900
Let's say at composable.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.910
And let's call this fun.

04:28.390 --> 04:36.190
Movie row now each row will need something, it will need an actual movie.

04:36.490 --> 04:39.310
So for now, I'm just going to put here movie.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.230
It's going to be just a string.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.630
OK, because you see each one of these movies that we're getting here, it's going to be a string.

04:46.630 --> 04:48.010
So this is going to be called.

04:49.090 --> 04:52.270
We're going to call inside here and get the structure going.

04:53.050 --> 04:54.310
So what is it that we want to do?

04:54.400 --> 04:57.370
Well, we want to have a card.

04:58.510 --> 05:04.300
So each one of these items, when we are calling the lazy column, it's going to go look through.

05:04.600 --> 05:12.880
We want to create a nice card around each one of these titles and maybe add more UI components or widgets.

05:13.490 --> 05:13.690
OK.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.340
So I'm going to create a card.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.650
I'm going to use a card because it has what I need.

05:17.950 --> 05:27.250
So this passive modifier modifier, let's give her a padding of about four dpi all around and feel max

05:27.250 --> 05:29.290
with like that.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.640
And let's give it a height

05:40.000 --> 05:42.760
of about 130 deep.

05:45.260 --> 05:53.180
And we can give it a shape because it's a card, we can pass a shape, let's say rounded corners, shape

05:54.200 --> 05:58.790
and we can see a corner passing the corner size radius.

05:59.510 --> 06:02.070
It doesn't matter to see corner sizes.

06:02.390 --> 06:07.910
I'm going to say 12 that deep, perhaps 16 to make it a little bit dramatic.

06:09.510 --> 06:12.110
And we can pass elevation, right?

06:12.660 --> 06:17.370
Say, six that deep to give that nice shadow and contrast.

06:18.060 --> 06:25.500
OK, so inside here, this is where I'm going to then copy or pass the actual text for an album and

06:25.510 --> 06:29.010
just pass this text that would say, what?

06:29.010 --> 06:30.210
Well, he's going to say movie.

06:30.510 --> 06:33.210
So just passing whatever strain we're getting.

06:33.270 --> 06:38.790
So now this movie role, we can call each side of our lazy column.

06:38.820 --> 06:45.120
Some say Movie Pro and expects the idea, which in this case, it's going to be a movie column.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.050
So we'll get rid of that and we'll refresh once again.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.150
And there you have it.

06:51.610 --> 06:56.640
OK, let's make it a decent size and you can see we have that very nice structure.

06:57.240 --> 07:02.370
OK, see, it has the border and it looks really nice.

07:02.490 --> 07:07.200
Of course, the text is to the left and it's kind of not looking great.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.620
So let's see what we can do.

07:08.640 --> 07:13.590
Well, as you know, by now, you can do all sorts of things, for instance, to start with.

07:13.620 --> 07:19.080
We can wrap this inside of a roll because we may want to add other items here, not just the title of

07:19.080 --> 07:19.730
the movie, right?

07:20.340 --> 07:22.560
So we can start customizing nothing new here.

07:22.770 --> 07:31.170
So let's put a row, and I'm going to say the vertical alignment alignment.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.700
I want a center vertically.

07:33.570 --> 07:33.900
OK.

07:34.770 --> 07:38.080
And then we want horizontal.

07:40.620 --> 07:48.660
They want horizontal arrangement to say, I want this to start, so it will always be good to start

07:48.660 --> 07:49.020
there.

07:49.650 --> 07:54.630
Now I'm going to just get our text and add inside of our row.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.490
And before that, we can say, Well, I want to add something else.

07:58.500 --> 08:04.110
Perhaps we can add an image here or an icon, OK, we can do that.

08:04.590 --> 08:06.450
Let's put it inside of a surface.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.150
It's easy to manage and put a modifier.

08:12.510 --> 08:14.940
Keep a padding of about 12 that deep.

08:16.950 --> 08:22.160
And I'm going to give it an overall size of about 100 deep.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.950
I'm going to pass a shape in this shape.

08:25.950 --> 08:29.330
I'm going to make it rectangular or rectangle shape.

08:31.250 --> 08:35.010
And give it another elevation here, can say about five deep.

08:36.240 --> 08:36.470
OK.

08:38.010 --> 08:40.020
All right, so what I want instead of a surface.

08:40.410 --> 08:47.910
Well, for now, this passing icon, let's use the first option with image of Vector and four image

08:47.910 --> 08:48.480
vector here.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.150
I can't invoke the icons library, right?

08:51.660 --> 08:56.400
And say default, and let's just say a count box so we can put whatever we want.

08:56.670 --> 09:02.250
But for now, we're just going to add that so we can have some sort of a placeholder is also valuable

09:02.250 --> 09:03.500
to visually impaired.

09:03.510 --> 09:07.140
We need to pass a content description for image icons and so forth.

09:07.150 --> 09:13.200
So in this case, I'm going to say image or may rather movie image.

09:16.080 --> 09:16.470
There you go.

09:16.830 --> 09:21.720
So let's go ahead and refresh this and see what's going to happen and what do you have?

09:22.140 --> 09:22.650
Very nice.

09:22.650 --> 09:26.040
So we have that very nice icon around it.

09:26.040 --> 09:32.190
You can see there we have this nice square and the text is showing to the right of the title of the

09:32.190 --> 09:32.520
movie.

09:33.000 --> 09:33.480
Very nice.

09:33.510 --> 09:37.350
Let's see if we can run this on an immolated or device.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.420
All right.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.110
So I'm running on my device.

09:41.250 --> 09:48.690
And I can see I have this very nice application with all of these rows that we just created.

09:48.960 --> 09:54.690
And the beauty here again, if I go up here and add a few more items in our list.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.680
Let's see.

10:11.040 --> 10:11.360
Hmm.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.970
Let's go ahead and rerun this.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.440
OK, there we go.

10:15.950 --> 10:22.250
And voila, it's a scrollable view and we have a list, and I'm going to look at my app here.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.760
You can see it's very smooth and.

10:27.070 --> 10:27.580
They'd have it.

10:28.970 --> 10:34.340
Just like that, we're able to put together a list of in this case, movies could be anything.

10:34.580 --> 10:41.930
And on top of that, we were able to create a row easily that would feed the actual movie title and

10:41.930 --> 10:42.620
it's out of this role.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.250
We can do whatever we want.

10:44.270 --> 10:45.200
We can customize it.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.450
We added a card because that's what we like.

10:47.810 --> 10:50.000
We put a row instead of this row.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.430
We have a surface where we have this icon and then we have the text.

10:54.470 --> 10:56.300
The actual movie title.

10:57.080 --> 10:57.770
And there you have it.

10:58.100 --> 11:04.070
The important thing here to notice is that we passed, we created this composable row, which is called

11:04.070 --> 11:11.240
inside of a lazy column, which of course, we are calling it inside of a main content composable.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.240
And then we're passing this movie list.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.370
We're just passing some data at this point.

11:16.970 --> 11:23.060
And then, of course, the lazy column takes that list and invokes the multiple row and passes in that

11:23.060 --> 11:23.390
data.

11:23.990 --> 11:28.910
And just like that, you can see that we have the scrollable list of movies.

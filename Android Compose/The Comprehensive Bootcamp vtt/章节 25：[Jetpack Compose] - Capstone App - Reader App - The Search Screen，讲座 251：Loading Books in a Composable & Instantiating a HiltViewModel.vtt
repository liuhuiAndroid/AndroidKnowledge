WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:04.650
So we've tested the app, and we know that we're getting data, which is wonderful.

00:05.100 --> 00:10.650
But how do we then get the data into our composable so we can work with it?

00:11.770 --> 00:17.160
What we do is, of course, we have search screen here and can pass the full model by saying book search

00:17.160 --> 00:19.530
view models and say illed of your model, OK?

00:20.250 --> 00:23.160
And then of course, that means the data that we want.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.810
It's going to be added or it has to be retrieved instead of book lists.

00:28.440 --> 00:35.220
So that means in our book lists here, we can also pass something like this or the model, and we're

00:35.220 --> 00:42.630
going to have an issue there because we have to say that book list needs to have if you model book search

00:42.630 --> 00:43.170
like this.

00:45.270 --> 00:49.800
And at this point, here will hope that and this point here, hopefully we can just say something like,

00:50.550 --> 00:52.830
Hi, go, let's say log.

00:54.470 --> 00:57.740
The right here, and I can say.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.460
View model.

01:01.210 --> 01:03.940
Go to a list of books, mutable state.

01:04.090 --> 01:07.300
Then go to value and then let's go ahead.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.490
Data like they see what happens.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.910
Let's add call is.

01:14.980 --> 01:15.860
Tag like this.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.870
Let's see what's going to happen.

01:16.900 --> 01:21.160
So you can see here now that in the beginning, we still have this book list book list.

01:21.430 --> 01:26.650
Tag is still empty and then we have this tag search books, not list change.

01:27.220 --> 01:30.700
I'm going to show you here something that's changed this tag to something different.

01:32.140 --> 01:37.360
Let's say search like this, so it's different, so we can see what I'm about to show you here.

01:39.250 --> 01:39.910
It's run again.

01:42.360 --> 01:42.640
OK.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.040
Click.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.350
All right.

01:44.370 --> 01:51.480
We see that we have Booklist Booklist still empty, and then we go to search this one here and shows

01:51.480 --> 01:51.810
that.

01:52.710 --> 01:57.760
But if we go back, let me actually search for Booklist.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.250
You'll see what will happen here.

01:59.430 --> 02:00.840
I actually add Booklist.

02:01.320 --> 02:06.960
You'll see that indeed, we start with empty, empty and then at some point, do we get that information?

02:07.560 --> 02:14.160
So this is very normal because remember, it takes a few milliseconds to go and get that data and pass

02:14.160 --> 02:16.560
it through our model for us to receive it.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.400
So it may seem that it's empty forever, but it's not really.

02:20.400 --> 02:28.050
So this is why we have added this list of books into a wrapper class.

02:28.230 --> 02:34.440
We can now to do something like this and can say if it's does test things we say, if you model, we're

02:34.440 --> 02:38.640
going to call and see dot list of books, right?

02:39.360 --> 02:48.120
And then or go to value to get actually the data or exception and say loading is true.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.320
If it's loading.

02:49.920 --> 02:56.280
I'm going to go ahead and say, show me a circle progress bar indicator like this.

02:57.300 --> 03:04.890
And what I can do also, I can say loading or log D. Let's see serial tag.

03:04.890 --> 03:06.480
Let's just say Boom.

03:06.510 --> 03:07.290
Like this, OK?

03:07.980 --> 03:10.650
And I'm going to say loading.

03:11.460 --> 03:12.210
Give it a time.

03:13.150 --> 03:19.890
Else we're just going to say log D. And let's just go ahead and get the list.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.910
In fact, it's actually, let's just take this.

03:25.850 --> 03:28.360
And put inside there, OK?

03:29.210 --> 03:34.880
And I'm going to do the same tag, so we're not confused like this will get the actual data.

03:34.910 --> 03:35.960
Let's see what's going to happen now.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.670
But right now?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.200
All right.

03:41.260 --> 03:45.940
Let's clear up, it's clear nicely, let's say Blue.

03:48.110 --> 03:52.160
That's the tag we added there, OK, so let's go.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.000
Aha, you saw there.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.260
It's hard for a bit.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.530
Let's go back.

03:58.950 --> 04:05.220
I'm going to click again and see it flat for a bit because it takes time and then we should see in our

04:05.220 --> 04:06.960
log blue.

04:08.050 --> 04:10.420
Where it started, let's see, there we go.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.670
Pool is loading.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.380
Who is loading?

04:14.680 --> 04:17.220
And then we ran search, so went ahead.

04:17.230 --> 04:23.080
Of course, first is going to show what we have here because this makes sense in our field model directly

04:23.710 --> 04:27.550
and then we'll see that scroll down.

04:28.910 --> 04:32.600
Let's just look for booklets, I think this is going to be better.

04:33.980 --> 04:37.670
Let's just look at a book list and you can see at some point, right?

04:37.700 --> 04:40.250
Loading, loading and then book lists to get information.

04:42.090 --> 04:42.360
All right.

04:42.630 --> 04:46.890
So that's one of the things that he can be very frustrating, especially when he debugging and because

04:46.890 --> 04:53.040
you're going to look at the logs and will say, well, nothing is coming in well, it just takes a little

04:53.040 --> 04:53.250
bit.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.470
Wait list is going to be empty in the beginning.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.710
Few milliseconds later, it will probably.

04:59.690 --> 05:07.940
So this is one of the reasons, again, that we have added, we wrapped our book list here mutable list,

05:08.660 --> 05:14.000
mutable state, that is who wrapped it around this data or exception because we are going to pass bullion

05:14.180 --> 05:15.290
an exception as well.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.700
But most important, now we have this bullion that we are setting up as we get the data right.

05:20.090 --> 05:20.510
We're safe.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.780
We're getting today, and I'm going to say loading to true such.

05:24.230 --> 05:31.850
And then we load our list of books of value by going to repository and get all the books passing the

05:31.850 --> 05:32.270
query.

05:32.450 --> 05:38.960
And there we have it, that the data may not be right away available because remember, we are going

05:39.170 --> 05:43.490
somewhere in a network that we have no control over and it takes time.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.210
All right.

05:45.050 --> 05:51.170
Make sure also, because we are in the nav where navigation here we need to instantiate our view model

05:51.170 --> 05:51.920
on hilt.

05:51.920 --> 05:59.480
If you model like this and pass the type in this case or book social model and then we pass it along

06:00.200 --> 06:06.470
as our review model there and in our search in this case, then we can instantiate just by saying view

06:06.470 --> 06:06.620
more.

06:06.830 --> 06:12.200
And once you have that in the root screen, in the root composable, then you can pass it along.

06:13.460 --> 06:19.670
And inside of the where you are going to call it, then you we have their few models already instantiated

06:19.670 --> 06:23.480
will be passing along and then we can just check for that data.

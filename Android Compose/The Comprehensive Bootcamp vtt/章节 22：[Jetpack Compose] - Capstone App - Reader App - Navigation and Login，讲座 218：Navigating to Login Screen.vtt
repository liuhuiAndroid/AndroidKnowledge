00:00.970 --> 00:03.850
So we have our animation working, that's delightful.

00:04.210 --> 00:07.180
Now let's see what we want to do next is as follows.

00:07.420 --> 00:15.010
The idea is that OK, once this animation is over, we want to take the users to the login screen.

00:16.030 --> 00:21.610
Now it depends because at this point, of course, this may not make a lot of sense, but the idea is

00:21.610 --> 00:29.410
that OK, actually, once the animation is over, we will have to check to make sure that if there is

00:29.410 --> 00:34.420
indeed a logged in FRB authorized user and we're not there yet, but we'll get there.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.400
Just I'm just trying to paint the picture.

00:36.880 --> 00:41.410
That's the reason why we have this delay here because want to delay a little bit and do something afterwards?

00:41.740 --> 00:42.610
What is it I want to do?

00:43.120 --> 00:50.380
Well, later we are going to put an if statement that will check to see if we have a user already authenticated.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.590
This is in the future or not.

00:52.600 --> 00:58.180
If that's the case, meaning there's no user authenticated, then we're going to take them to the login

00:58.180 --> 00:58.630
screen.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.960
Otherwise, we take them straight to our reader home screen.

01:02.410 --> 01:02.650
OK.

01:03.070 --> 01:03.870
We're going to do that later.

01:05.230 --> 01:11.230
But for now, all we're going to do really is use our navigator or nav controller, I should say, and

01:11.230 --> 01:18.010
I'm going to get rid of this altogether because we don't need to pretend that we want to see the contents

01:18.010 --> 01:20.150
of our splash screen here.

01:20.150 --> 01:23.620
It looks like I'm having some issues, right?

01:23.800 --> 01:24.940
Probably get rid of one of these.

01:25.030 --> 01:25.450
There we go.

01:26.110 --> 01:26.350
All right.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.810
Because we will need this nav controller.

01:27.820 --> 01:32.890
This is the beauty, because now that we have an app controller controls in navigation, it means this

01:32.890 --> 01:36.850
is where direct, where we want to do like Dot, navigate to X.

01:37.330 --> 01:37.930
We need that.

01:38.350 --> 01:39.580
Now I can do that right.

01:40.260 --> 01:40.500
Right?

01:40.570 --> 01:43.990
We can do that so we can take our nav controller just enough controller.

01:44.410 --> 01:51.940
Look how easy this is that I can say, navigate and make sure you pick the correct navigation method

01:51.940 --> 01:52.150
here.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.360
There's a few, and we want the one that is correct.

01:55.630 --> 02:01.980
We want the one with the root string as such, and we're going to pass here the actual navigation.

02:01.990 --> 02:03.400
So I'm going to say I'm going to go to.

02:04.210 --> 02:07.740
OK, let's go back there so you can see what it is that I want to do.

02:07.750 --> 02:13.480
I want to go to reader screens, how the beauty is that now I can go reader screens.

02:14.020 --> 02:20.950
I go that that guy there, the integrated class enum class start.

02:21.220 --> 02:27.460
I want to go to our login screen that name, just like that.

02:28.610 --> 02:29.150
And I'm done.

02:29.510 --> 02:32.310
I have my controller, I say navigate past.

02:33.690 --> 02:35.400
Path or the route?

02:37.430 --> 02:38.570
Is that going to work?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.580
I see when I run.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.250
Oops, looks like we have some issues here.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.680
Let's go ahead and look at the run.

02:48.730 --> 02:53.140
Let's run again to see, OK, we have a few problems.

02:54.560 --> 02:54.770
OK.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.360
What seems to be the problem, say, is no such method error.

02:58.690 --> 03:06.760
Go Splash and appears in data, so looks like we don't have the navigation of click here.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.820
It says let's go to a reader navigation line.

03:09.820 --> 03:10.420
18.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.180
OK, so when we say readers splash screen, we have now have controller.

03:15.870 --> 03:16.810
We don't have.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.220
All right.

03:17.700 --> 03:23.910
So looking at this, you can see that something is not right because we don't have the log in composable

03:23.910 --> 03:24.630
here, right?

03:24.630 --> 03:25.230
Our screen.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.610
Of course, we're going to have issues.

03:27.610 --> 03:36.360
So I'm going to copy this and paste there to create the actual log in screen, that name like such.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.220
And it's going to be a log in the screen and let's see reader log in screen.

03:41.460 --> 03:41.940
There we go.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.110
Let's go to our login screen.

03:44.130 --> 03:48.340
We're going to pass our nav controller, so we should have done this before.

03:48.360 --> 03:48.800
It's okay.

03:48.810 --> 03:49.590
We're doing it now.

03:50.460 --> 03:54.960
And now this should go away this error.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.820
OK, just make sure you understand what's happening.

03:57.090 --> 04:03.240
What happened was that it wasn't recognizing this composable because there was no composable here screen

04:03.450 --> 04:08.730
that would give us direction to where to get to, to how to get to reader login screen.

04:09.390 --> 04:16.020
That's why we was complaining because we didn't have the reader screen reader login screen attached

04:16.020 --> 04:17.910
here in our nav hosts.

04:18.270 --> 04:18.810
It makes sense.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.330
All right, so let's go ahead and give it another try.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.190
Hopefully, this time we'll have no problems.

04:23.610 --> 04:29.310
And while we can see we have that animation and we go to this blank screen, that it's not very eventful

04:29.310 --> 04:33.060
because we have nothing there, it's OK, but at least we know things are working.

04:33.270 --> 04:38.670
So right here I can just say text our infamous text that says.

04:40.940 --> 04:47.480
Log in screen, so perhaps you can fill a little bit better about our efforts.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.680
This one again.

04:50.940 --> 04:51.350
OK.

04:51.420 --> 04:57.030
There is wait for two seconds and voila, logon screen is showing nice.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.090
It's working.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.310
Navigation is working.

04:59.520 --> 05:05.850
And of course, you always have to make sure that we actually have the the Navajos that we actually

05:05.850 --> 05:08.970
have added screen to navigate to right here.

05:09.000 --> 05:09.600
It's very important.

05:10.230 --> 05:11.340
OK, good.

05:11.430 --> 05:12.010
This is good.

05:12.030 --> 05:13.380
So life is really good.

05:13.530 --> 05:18.510
Things are working perfectly and we should be very happy because the application is over.

05:19.170 --> 05:19.770
Just kidding.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.060
We still have a lot of work to do.

00:00.690 --> 00:01.020
All right.

00:01.050 --> 00:01.950
Welcome back.

00:02.190 --> 00:10.380
Now we are back to home screen because we have some other business to take care of here, mainly because

00:10.380 --> 00:16.650
we want to be able to show the books that we have saved into our database in our reading list and hopefully

00:16.650 --> 00:22.800
later be able to click on the reading list book so that we can change the status of that book to say

00:22.800 --> 00:26.340
that we are now reading that book, as you see at the top there.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.230
So we have two different categories.

00:28.230 --> 00:33.930
We have the reading list, the books that we just added, and then we are going to tap on the books

00:33.930 --> 00:39.840
that we just added and then set it to say, OK, we're starting reading this book, and once we have

00:39.840 --> 00:45.510
set it that way, then these books are going to be shown at the top there because there will be the

00:46.200 --> 00:47.730
activity right now, right?

00:47.730 --> 00:49.320
The reading activity right now book.

00:49.740 --> 00:50.730
We are getting there.

00:50.730 --> 00:51.840
And let's do it.

00:51.930 --> 00:52.380
Let's go.

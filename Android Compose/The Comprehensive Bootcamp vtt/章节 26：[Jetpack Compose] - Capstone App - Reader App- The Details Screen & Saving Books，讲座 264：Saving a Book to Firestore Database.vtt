WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:05.520
We now have our own book set up, so let's go back to our detailed screen and see you can save a book.

00:05.820 --> 00:08.490
I had a few of the properties there real quick.

00:09.390 --> 00:13.560
So let's start with title because that seems to be important.

00:14.070 --> 00:18.900
And how do I pass the title, where they are or where do I get that information from when I say book

00:20.520 --> 00:20.970
data?

00:21.180 --> 00:21.960
For this book data?

00:23.230 --> 00:30.900
We have access to it because we inside of our show book details and we created at the top there UK,

00:30.970 --> 00:37.000
where a single currency looked at an going to get his title to a string as such.

00:38.590 --> 00:46.750
And then I'm going to add authors, OK, book data authors to a string.

00:47.140 --> 00:48.310
It's just very boring.

00:48.350 --> 00:55.090
I do realize this, but nonetheless we have to do this and the description to string

00:57.850 --> 01:00.940
the categories book data.

01:02.220 --> 01:05.190
Categories to string.

01:05.520 --> 01:13.980
Looks like he doesn't need me to do so, so let's go ahead and replace Jess with a dot, as it says

01:15.090 --> 01:16.350
it doesn't need that either.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.450
OK, I continue here.

01:18.810 --> 01:23.050
I'm going to put notes for now, notes just going to have an empty string as such.

01:23.510 --> 01:24.690
That will be added later.

01:24.940 --> 01:25.470
That's fine.

01:26.190 --> 01:28.080
And photo your al.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.030
Look at her.

01:32.320 --> 01:43.000
Images that thumbnail and then published date the same thing, page count, book data.

01:45.350 --> 01:51.230
Now, page count is going to come in as integer, I believe, so I'm going to say to string.

01:53.030 --> 01:53.960
Is that true?

01:53.990 --> 01:54.860
Let's see.

01:56.120 --> 02:04.820
All right, and then we're up to a string like this pitch count is indeed just a string, so it's OK

02:04.910 --> 02:13.130
we can do such and let's see rating well now, would you say 0.0?

02:13.190 --> 02:14.120
That's just the beginning.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.730
And then I'm past Google Book.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.200
I'd say Google.

02:18.290 --> 02:18.800
Book it.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.360
Remember this Google book idea?

02:21.700 --> 02:29.300
We're getting that from our Google book, where we got from book info that data that it last but not

02:29.300 --> 02:36.440
least get a pass or user ID to get your user ID again, because we love Firebase and Firebase is everywhere.

02:36.770 --> 02:38.600
You can see Firebase offers.

02:40.880 --> 02:49.710
That good instance, and it can get current user and get you I.D. and say to a stranger like this.

02:51.030 --> 02:51.570
And there we go.

02:51.840 --> 02:59.700
This will give us a united our idea of the current user that's logged in, and I know for sure you will

02:59.700 --> 03:07.110
have a current user ID because you can't enter or we can't do anything in this app without having an

03:07.110 --> 03:07.500
account.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.210
So you will have an ID.

03:09.780 --> 03:10.470
And there you have it.

03:10.830 --> 03:17.220
So now we have created this object, our book object, which is ready to be saved on, told everybody.

03:17.250 --> 03:22.290
So let's go to our save to Firebase is this book has been passed, right?

03:24.120 --> 03:26.320
So now here we have created.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.860
Indeed, our database instance there.

03:29.050 --> 03:31.490
Well, let's see.

03:32.050 --> 03:35.370
Database collection is such an ongoing DB.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.200
We say collection.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.810
I'm going to create a collection right now is going to be called books.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.340
OK, I'm going to use those.

03:42.930 --> 03:43.390
All right.

03:43.410 --> 03:46.560
So I'm going to put an if statement here to make sure that all is good.

03:46.560 --> 03:57.360
And I say if the string, whatever we getting that object is not empty, that's the case, then we are

03:57.360 --> 03:58.030
ready to go.

03:58.050 --> 04:00.240
Else, we're going to do something else.

04:00.510 --> 04:00.810
OK.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.160
So in say here because we know the book is not empty, so it's actually a valid book.

04:06.630 --> 04:13.290
This is where I'm going to say, well, DB Collection can use that collection reference and select Add

04:13.860 --> 04:14.220
to that.

04:15.030 --> 04:23.100
And then I'm going to add our, yes, our book object, and then I'm going to attach a and add on success

04:23.580 --> 04:24.720
listener as such.

04:25.410 --> 04:32.610
And we're save document wrath so much so we can check if things are good.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.800
We're going to be clever here a little bit.

04:35.670 --> 04:44.700
Well, the idea is that, OK, so once that book is saved right, we are going to snap the reference

04:44.700 --> 04:49.830
ID of that book was anything that saved in that their base will have a reference ID.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.270
It's all made.

04:52.050 --> 04:56.530
What I mean by that when we save something that document is created, we're going to have this idea,

04:57.330 --> 04:57.590
right?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.710
So what are we going to do?

05:01.880 --> 05:07.790
We're going to save the book and the moment we save the book, we get the document reference is going

05:07.790 --> 05:08.070
to be this.

05:08.780 --> 05:17.270
And then right after we do that, we're going to update the same book one field and add the new ID for

05:17.270 --> 05:17.630
the book.

05:19.510 --> 05:20.260
In this case.

05:21.360 --> 05:30.630
We're going to go back to our book passing the ID in this ID field, because remember, this ID field

05:30.780 --> 05:36.900
is actually going to be inside of the book, which we don't have here.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.510
I'm just referencing what you can see, but they did same.

05:39.930 --> 05:46.590
We actually are going to have it as a property or a field in our document because I see if I see users,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.760
this document is just a document ID.

05:48.990 --> 05:53.070
But I want to add that Document ID if you think about it into the field.

05:53.820 --> 05:59.460
So I can then check later to see if that where that book belong and what it is and so forth.

05:59.730 --> 06:03.890
OK, so where we are, we are safe to database.

06:03.900 --> 06:07.140
OK, safe to Firebase because we get so we have this document reference.

06:07.470 --> 06:16.110
OK, now what I'm going to do and I say, wow, I say Doc ID and it was a document reference.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.790
I'm going to get that ID right away.

06:18.300 --> 06:22.560
OK, once I have that ID, then I'm going to say database.

06:23.040 --> 06:29.250
So I'm going to say DB collection, and I'm going to say, let's go to a document.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.730
This document, I need to pass the idea of this document.

06:32.750 --> 06:39.420
Well, this document is going to be a document reference that ID or equity just pass.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.460
This idea that it created here, let's do that because the same thing, right?

06:44.700 --> 06:53.520
So now I'm getting to that document we just created and then I'm going to say that update Oh, now look

06:53.520 --> 06:54.270
how cool this is.

06:54.750 --> 06:58.380
I can update one field only if I need to.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.300
I don't have to update the whole document.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.280
Interesting.

07:02.550 --> 07:09.240
So in this case here to update one field, we know that we need to pass a hash map of any type.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.080
So I'm going to just do it here.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.720
It was a hash map of.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.650
I know.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.670
Go back to book.

07:14.940 --> 07:21.240
I have this I.D., which was ignored before it excluded, right when we created this and book.

07:21.990 --> 07:23.340
But now we're going to go back to it.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.600
I'm going to get this idea and to do so, I'm going to put it inside of it.

07:29.340 --> 07:34.700
I'm going to relate that to what I'm going to say to our doc.

07:34.830 --> 07:42.030
I'd like that and of course, we want us to cast that as a map like this.

07:43.020 --> 07:43.590
Does that make sense?

07:44.070 --> 07:52.590
So the moment we save this book that we saved right away, when we know that there is success that happened,

07:52.600 --> 07:57.330
so we were actually saved something, we have this document reference, which contains the aid of this

07:57.330 --> 08:03.660
document, a book that was just saved, what we do next, each as we removed that aid, putting it inside

08:03.660 --> 08:04.410
of the stockade.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.260
And then we go back, it's a collection.

08:08.370 --> 08:16.150
Get that document ID that we just added, and I'm going to update one field ID and pass in the Doc I.D.

08:16.320 --> 08:29.250
that we just got and we can attach to add on complete listener such letter lambda.

08:30.030 --> 08:35.530
And this is going to be a task which will have more information that we may need to use.

08:36.300 --> 08:43.170
So now I can say, well, OK, if all of that worked out, which is wonderful, we can test or check

08:43.170 --> 08:49.440
writing and say if task is successful, right?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.170
Following the successful, that means we're good.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.830
What do I need to do?

08:53.850 --> 08:58.560
I'm going to say NAF controller fact this point because I don't have access to that.

08:59.070 --> 09:06.300
Let's, first of all, make this a composable and which means we need to change this and I'm going to

09:06.300 --> 09:08.190
pass here in NAF controller.

09:08.430 --> 09:09.330
I such as well.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.370
OK, so now we have the controller.

09:11.730 --> 09:15.840
I say Dot Pop Stack there, that's it.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.140
And then I'm going to also say add on failure listener.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.180
In this case, I was just going to say log.

09:28.560 --> 09:35.070
I believe like that and just say something like, well, life is not good.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.720
Say era error updating.

09:41.520 --> 09:41.940
Doc?

09:44.670 --> 09:44.930
Oops!

09:45.570 --> 09:52.230
This is going to be this is where I put the actual document like the exception for say.

09:54.790 --> 09:55.250
Like this?

09:55.330 --> 09:55.570
OK.

09:56.110 --> 09:56.620
All right.

09:57.400 --> 10:04.450
This would change this save for her base and to pass it to Paris knife controller like that.

10:07.810 --> 10:09.400
Let's just remove all of that.

10:09.470 --> 10:09.970
Keep it.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.230
What we had before.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.170
OK.

10:15.240 --> 10:20.520
That should be OK, because we instead of a composable and then we have that issue, we can't call it.

10:21.030 --> 10:21.330
All right.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.280
Let's check it up and see if this works.

10:28.240 --> 10:28.990
OK, let's go.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.650
Let's see Flutter today.

10:32.950 --> 10:33.580
Safe.

10:35.240 --> 10:35.630
OK.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.740
Let's see, that's true, because it took us back to where we needed to be.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.470
That's a moment of truth.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.190
Let's refresh.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.640
We should see books collection there and hopefully with her book.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.440
And what do you know?

10:48.460 --> 10:49.100
Have a book?

10:50.790 --> 10:51.310
Voila!

10:51.450 --> 10:54.840
And it's exactly that book that we just added, Oh.

10:56.810 --> 10:58.170
This is so exciting.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.720
Ladies and gentlemen, and look at this, this is important because we even added.

11:02.390 --> 11:08.990
Look at this ad. It's exactly the same as the book document I.D., which is exactly what we wanted.

11:10.610 --> 11:13.100
We have these already wonderful.

11:14.750 --> 11:15.380
This is great.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.430
So let's say I'm going to add another book on running.

11:22.470 --> 11:23.160
About that one.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.620
Yes, I read about it.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.320
All the things and stay safe and I get back there.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.040
They come here.

11:34.840 --> 11:38.350
So refresh, we should see a second book about running.

11:42.350 --> 11:42.830
There you go.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.530
Very well, it's working.

11:46.490 --> 11:46.970
All right.

11:47.240 --> 11:47.760
All right.

11:47.780 --> 11:49.190
This is very exciting.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.380
Oh, all that work.

11:51.920 --> 11:56.890
And we're now seeing things actually happening, so we know things are working.

11:56.900 --> 12:03.140
And obviously next, the next thing we need to do is to come back to Maine here and start showing the

12:03.140 --> 12:09.380
books that we have been saving for this user showing them here, at least in the reading list.

12:11.200 --> 12:11.620
All right.

12:11.770 --> 12:12.430
I'll see you next.

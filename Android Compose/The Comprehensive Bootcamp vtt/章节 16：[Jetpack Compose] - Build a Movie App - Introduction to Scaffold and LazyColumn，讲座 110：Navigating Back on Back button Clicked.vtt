WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:07.350
So we're very happy that we able to pass data, so we click we go to the details page or screen, and

00:07.350 --> 00:11.520
we're passing the avatar with this case, the movie title, so it can go back.

00:11.940 --> 00:14.730
Now this going back here can see this is a button in.

00:14.730 --> 00:19.590
Some of your phones may have a back button, but it can see newer phones.

00:19.590 --> 00:22.810
Nowadays, they don't really have this physical back button.

00:22.950 --> 00:24.660
In fact, mine doesn't really have that.

00:24.900 --> 00:32.100
The reason why I have it here is because I'm running this software that is mirroring my phone, so it

00:32.100 --> 00:34.290
just gives this back home buttons.

00:34.740 --> 00:41.040
So and also on top of that, you can see that we have this top bar here, which allows us to put all

00:41.040 --> 00:41.580
sorts of things.

00:41.850 --> 00:44.220
So if you click here, I notice we don't have that there.

00:44.580 --> 00:47.370
It will be nice to have our top bar there as well.

00:47.820 --> 00:55.440
But before that, let's understand how do we go back to the main screen this case home without hitting

00:55.440 --> 00:56.160
the back button?

00:56.520 --> 00:57.840
So let's start small.

00:58.710 --> 01:06.270
So inside of our detailed screen right after the text, I can just go ahead and say, Button, just

01:06.270 --> 01:08.120
create a simple button, right?

01:08.520 --> 01:09.930
And then we have the one click.

01:10.350 --> 01:17.280
Given that and then inside here, instead of a button, we're going to put a text white kind of some

01:17.280 --> 01:21.540
kind of a label to say what this button is supposed to do, right?

01:21.840 --> 01:24.110
So some kind of a label.

01:24.120 --> 01:27.360
So I'm going to say here, go back like this.

01:28.110 --> 01:31.020
Let's just put some space or a are here.

01:31.050 --> 01:35.130
I want the modifier height.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.180
Such let's give it about twenty three dpi.

01:40.650 --> 01:43.320
Let's go ahead and put dpi my section.

01:43.350 --> 01:44.280
OK, very good.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.480
So let's go ahead and run again.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.950
OK, let's go to 300, you can see there is a back button.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.210
All right, nice.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.650
Now what is they want to do?

01:54.680 --> 02:01.040
Well, we just want to go back to the previous screen in this case, his previous composable now because

02:01.430 --> 02:06.440
the way navigation works is that we do have a stack that happens as we navigate.

02:06.830 --> 02:16.250
So when we go from our main screen here, our home screen, this is the first item on the stack and

02:16.250 --> 02:17.990
we click, we go to this one.

02:18.350 --> 02:25.550
Then we now this is the one on top of the first stack, right on top of the first item in our stack.

02:26.610 --> 02:31.800
To go back at that means we have to pop the screen, which is on top of the stack right now, that way,

02:31.800 --> 02:34.170
then we can go to the previous item on the stack.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.790
So what do we do in our own?

02:35.790 --> 02:36.270
Click here?

02:36.300 --> 02:36.990
It's very simple.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.790
Now, remember, this is the beauty.

02:38.970 --> 02:41.760
That's why we passed the NAF controller all along.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.360
Ah, so the Snap controller here I can use it.

02:45.360 --> 02:51.450
I can say nav controller because again, it controls everything, knows what needs to be done, and

02:51.450 --> 02:52.920
it directs everything right.

02:53.020 --> 02:54.000
It gets enough controller.

02:54.390 --> 02:59.280
Look at this again that can say pop back or it can navigate again.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.420
Remember this?

03:00.540 --> 03:00.840
Right?

03:01.410 --> 03:04.950
So what I want, I just want to say, I'm just going to pop back stack.

03:06.170 --> 03:06.620
That's all.

03:07.790 --> 03:12.710
If I run a reporter, go back, not go back.

03:13.730 --> 03:14.180
All right.

03:14.390 --> 03:14.870
Very good.

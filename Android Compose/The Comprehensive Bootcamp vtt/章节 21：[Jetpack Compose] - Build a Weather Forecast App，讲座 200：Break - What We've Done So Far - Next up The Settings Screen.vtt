00:00.910 --> 00:09.900
All right, so we again finished another part of our application here, so we're able to add the saving

00:10.170 --> 00:12.250
properties, the saving seeds here.

00:12.270 --> 00:17.280
So click on a button, click on this icon there to save a city.

00:17.400 --> 00:23.580
So now we were able to not only see all the favorites, but also see all the seeds that we have saved

00:23.850 --> 00:24.600
as favorites.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.430
And so when they click on those seeds, they can either delete them or they can.

00:29.430 --> 00:36.000
Also, when click the city row, they can go back to our main activity, or they can go back to a main

00:36.000 --> 00:39.420
screen and see the weather forecast for that city.

00:40.160 --> 00:40.500
All right.

00:40.770 --> 00:47.220
So we also added the visual kind of the clues, such as the toast message, to make sure that when they

00:47.220 --> 00:49.020
save, of course, the seeds saved.

00:49.590 --> 00:55.200
The users can see that toast message to see to say that, OK, indeed, they have saved something daughter

00:55.200 --> 00:59.430
base and also made sure that no seed can be saved twice.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.620
Even though we know that the structure we have for this strategy in our database that we have set up

01:04.920 --> 01:12.570
is that if something is added twice, then it just points to danger, just goes and overrides that item.

01:12.870 --> 01:19.260
But it's always nice to give that visual clue to the user, even though we know in the back end everything

01:19.260 --> 01:19.710
is set up.

01:19.950 --> 01:28.230
So now, if the seed already exists in the database and we don't see the the favorite icon showing there,

01:28.230 --> 01:31.110
which means they can't really see something they already have.

01:32.020 --> 01:32.710
OK, very good.

01:33.190 --> 01:38.500
So we are really getting close to finalizing this entire application, this awesome application.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.090
Hopefully, you're learning a lot.

01:40.420 --> 01:46.000
What do we need to do next to finish everything is we're going to look at these settings screen.

01:46.030 --> 01:52.600
The idea is very simple, which is we're going to change or allow users to change between Celsius,

01:52.900 --> 02:00.550
which is the metric system and Fahrenheit, which is the imperial unit system unit of measurement,

02:00.790 --> 02:01.270
if you will.

02:01.720 --> 02:08.110
So we're going to use a database to do so, although because it's such a small piece of data, we could

02:08.110 --> 02:13.810
have used something less less large per say, less complicated.

02:13.810 --> 02:19.180
But because we have a database already, I just figured let's just use that is just going to make things

02:19.180 --> 02:19.990
much simpler.

02:20.350 --> 02:24.220
And you are already well versed with databases.

02:24.220 --> 02:25.120
So it's just easy.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.490
It's just a matter of adding a new table that will hold these units and go from there.

02:30.850 --> 02:38.110
OK, so we're going to create that structure so users can actually see either in Celsius or in Fahrenheit.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.190
All right, let's go ahead and do that.

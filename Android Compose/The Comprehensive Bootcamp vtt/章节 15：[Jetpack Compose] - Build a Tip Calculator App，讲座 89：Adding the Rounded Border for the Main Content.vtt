WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:07.620
So let's start looking at this other area here, which we will call the main content within this area,

00:07.630 --> 00:11.680
we have other many, any other composer what we need to put together.

00:12.430 --> 00:18.820
So again, I'm going to come up here and let's close this down, Foldit, I should say, and we're going

00:18.820 --> 00:25.570
to fall top header and right at the bottom here, I'm going to go ahead and work on something else.

00:26.890 --> 00:28.510
Let's say at composable again.

00:36.980 --> 00:42.650
It's a function, let's call this main content such.

00:44.570 --> 00:45.260
And there we have it.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.520
OK, I'm going to make this.

00:50.530 --> 00:54.280
The ad preview so can preview it.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.430
And if you want, you can just go ahead and.

00:58.990 --> 01:01.990
Comment this out, though, we don't have too many previews at once, right?

01:02.170 --> 01:02.730
That's fine.

01:02.740 --> 01:05.190
Either way works, but there we go.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.330
We have a preview on our main content.

01:07.690 --> 01:10.120
So our main content, again, we have all of this.

01:10.330 --> 01:16.140
So you see in the outer layers here, we have this very nice order here.

01:16.150 --> 01:18.730
So let's go ahead and see how can we put together such a thing?

01:19.450 --> 01:20.860
So go ahead.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.810
I'm going to use surface again.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.400
And then instead of our surface here, let me go back and I'm going to put a modifier.

01:30.820 --> 01:31.690
What's new?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.370
And let's go ahead and keep padding.

01:39.540 --> 01:45.240
I'm about to dive deep, so for all padding of to like that too deep?

01:45.900 --> 01:55.620
OK, so still there I go and make sure that we fill Max with and then we're going to get out of our

01:55.620 --> 01:56.220
modifier.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.080
So we want to create this structure here that is like just a border.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.910
OK, so what do we need to do?

02:03.240 --> 02:05.070
Is past shape?

02:05.460 --> 02:06.030
Yes.

02:06.390 --> 02:12.750
And in this case, I could use the circle shape or rounded corners or rounded.

02:12.990 --> 02:18.030
Let's see what we call, what do we use here, which was a rounded corner of shape.

02:19.140 --> 02:24.780
We can use rounded corner shape just to differentiate, but both of them yield to the same thing, really.

02:25.080 --> 02:25.890
So I'm going to say.

02:28.500 --> 02:38.910
Rounded corners, shape and form, the shape, see and the four corner here, a corner.

02:40.840 --> 02:47.740
And let's give it about eight ADP because we don't want the corners to be too curved, we want them

02:47.740 --> 02:51.040
to be a little bit curved just like this.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.260
So essentially kind of like this.

02:53.530 --> 02:53.770
OK.

02:54.460 --> 02:54.720
All right.

02:54.830 --> 02:55.330
Stay with you.

02:55.900 --> 03:01.870
Now the other thing we can also pass if you have for, you know, a surface is that we can pass if you

03:01.870 --> 03:03.610
other things, which is the border.

03:03.940 --> 03:07.930
You know the argument here, this is real helpful because that's exactly what we want.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.170
So afterwards here, I'm going to say border.

03:13.740 --> 03:20.130
And you can see the tape that is expecting is border stroke, toxic border border stroke.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.860
As far as that, and we have a few override methods here.

03:26.190 --> 03:28.710
Let's just get the second one.

03:29.040 --> 03:34.940
So the width of the stroke we can pass here, we just want something small.

03:34.950 --> 03:39.540
It's a width six one dpi that's fine.

03:39.540 --> 03:40.530
Nothing too thick.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.610
And for the color, I'm going to say color.

03:44.910 --> 03:48.060
It's going to use the light gray that comes with.

03:51.220 --> 03:51.770
I'm just going to go.

03:53.870 --> 03:57.400
Let's just say light gray, these is the color that we want.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.630
So it's going to be this color.

03:59.630 --> 04:00.620
They're just like gray.

04:02.080 --> 04:02.380
OK.

04:02.740 --> 04:09.850
Of course, we can get rid of these residual one things to do that is you click out option and enter

04:10.120 --> 04:12.520
and then remove redundant qualifier name.

04:12.970 --> 04:14.440
All right, so now just have surface.

04:15.070 --> 04:18.190
OK, and inside here what I can do.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.610
And inside, of course, this surface here notice this is where we're going to add all of these other

04:28.270 --> 04:37.360
UI widgets and all of them are in, all of them are one after the other, which tells us which all of

04:37.360 --> 04:42.070
them are one after the other vertically, which tells us again, we have a column.

04:42.280 --> 04:42.510
All right.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.420
Let's just go ahead and add to that column because we're not going to use it anyway.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.810
And for now here, I'm just going to add some gibberish.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.980
Just give a text.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.250
Hello and a few hellos here.

04:58.330 --> 04:58.690
OK.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.770
Let's go ahead and refresh just to see what we are going to see.

05:08.780 --> 05:09.380
And there we go.

05:09.590 --> 05:14.960
It's really small with so make this a little bigger.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.260
And if you look closely.

05:22.750 --> 05:28.540
Its tax rate over the year, you can see that we have that very nice border there, in fact, it can

05:28.540 --> 05:32.080
exaggerate this to 12 and you can see there it is or a border.

05:32.500 --> 05:32.980
All right.

05:34.030 --> 05:37.510
The stroke, I should say the border stroke, as you see there.

05:38.230 --> 05:39.030
OK, so it's there.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.730
We want about one to four now, so we can actually see.

05:43.180 --> 05:43.560
All right.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.260
So we have it.

05:44.620 --> 05:45.490
It's looking really good.

05:45.700 --> 05:46.480
It will look better.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.070
All right.

05:48.070 --> 05:48.460
There we go.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.290
So we have this structure that we need.

05:50.590 --> 05:52.300
Of course, we don't need all these hellos.

05:52.300 --> 05:57.460
We actually are going to replace all of that with all of these other things, other UI components.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.370
But at least we have the main shell, if you will, which is this structure here.

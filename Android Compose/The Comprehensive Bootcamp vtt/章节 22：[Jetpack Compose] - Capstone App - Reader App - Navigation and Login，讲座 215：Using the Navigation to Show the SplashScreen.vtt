WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:04.550
OK, so we have our reader navigation here, where is that going to be called?

00:04.590 --> 00:13.900
Well, because the reader navigation will encloses all of our destinations, all of our all of our navigation,

00:13.900 --> 00:18.650
honorable composable screens and so forth that needs to be called inside of our main right.

00:18.670 --> 00:25.420
So if I go to a main screen or main activity that is somewhere here that needs to be called, so let's

00:25.420 --> 00:30.190
go ahead and get rid of all of this stuff that we don't really need.

00:30.940 --> 00:33.580
Now let me go ahead and add a modifier as well.

00:37.230 --> 00:45.690
Phil Max size to say that this will just fill the max size for both ways, the height and the width.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.410
And while I'm here, I'm just going to head and say padding.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.540
Top of about.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.130
46 BP.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.370
OK, we'll see that in action later.

00:59.820 --> 01:00.750
OK, so we go.

01:01.410 --> 01:04.260
So, you know, surface, this is where are we going to add?

01:04.380 --> 01:07.530
Of course, the actual navigation.

01:07.620 --> 01:13.050
But I'm going to do this a little bit differently because we want to separate the concerns here.

01:13.680 --> 01:19.350
I'm going to create yet another composable here called reader app.

01:20.160 --> 01:24.320
And in fact, I'm going to get all of this.

01:27.450 --> 01:31.500
Inside here, that's what we need.

01:32.340 --> 01:35.260
Let's remove that padding because we don't need that for now.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.540
We can always change that.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.580
And then inside here, I'm going to create a column.

01:39.290 --> 01:39.620
OK?

01:40.260 --> 01:42.730
It's a vertical arrangement.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.880
I'm going to say center.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.800
And the thing has to be in the middle and horizontal.

01:50.070 --> 01:54.540
Oops, that has to be side of properties.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.340
So horizontal alignment.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.830
I want this center horizontally.

01:59.340 --> 02:03.900
Such and then here is what I'm going to call the reader navigation.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.230
OK, and of course, that's reader app.

02:07.240 --> 02:16.530
It's going to be called inside here reader app such as Make Sure We Don't Have an issues and that's

02:16.530 --> 02:19.530
OK because we don't have the reading anymore.

02:20.810 --> 02:27.620
All right, so this is how we have now set up our reader navigation to be the center of everything writing

02:27.630 --> 02:29.180
notice in our main activity now.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.350
We don't have much.

02:30.830 --> 02:36.780
We just called the reader app, which indeed calls surface creates a surface, and then we have the

02:36.790 --> 02:38.480
reader navigation enclosed.

02:38.930 --> 02:44.960
Now the beauty here is that let me get rid of all of these other screens and make sure they're a little

02:44.960 --> 02:45.500
splash.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.830
For now, I'm just going to add a text.

02:51.410 --> 02:52.160
Let's say as.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.470
Splash screen as such.

02:56.720 --> 03:03.820
OK, so you can see now because we have everything set up in our we don't navigation, we know the starting

03:03.820 --> 03:09.730
point now, our navigation here, the starting start, this destination is going to be screen search

03:10.330 --> 03:12.190
actually should be splash screen.

03:12.670 --> 03:15.350
That's a mistake, not search screen.

03:15.370 --> 03:15.820
There we go.

03:16.300 --> 03:16.660
All right.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.610
That was a mistake.

03:17.620 --> 03:18.310
Yes, fine.

03:18.310 --> 03:18.850
We fixed it.

03:19.150 --> 03:20.760
So they start this.

03:20.770 --> 03:21.250
They start.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.220
This nation has to be the splash screen.

03:24.910 --> 03:31.570
What it means, then, is that when we run this app, if all things go well, we should see the splash

03:31.570 --> 03:37.600
screen showing which mean it's going to be our readers splash screen with this text.

03:38.080 --> 03:38.590
Is that true?

03:38.920 --> 03:39.940
Well, let's hope so.

03:40.140 --> 03:40.900
Let's run this.

03:41.920 --> 03:42.400
All right.

03:43.060 --> 03:43.790
There it is.

03:43.810 --> 03:46.240
You can see it, says splash screen.

03:46.330 --> 03:49.600
Because that's the first starting point.

03:49.690 --> 03:54.520
The first destination we added into our reader navigation there.

03:54.670 --> 03:55.480
This is really good.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.590
That means everything is working.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.560
If you don't see the splash screen, then something is not right.

03:59.590 --> 04:04.550
Make sure you look at the code, make sure everything is set up dependencies and everything.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.440
But you should be able to see that now we have our splash screen.

04:08.470 --> 04:13.990
We should show as the first composable the first screen that needs to be shown here.

04:15.640 --> 04:20.980
Now, take a moment to look at this because is structuring everything like we did here.

04:21.370 --> 04:27.040
It's going to help immensely, as I said, because if you end up with an app that contains that has

04:27.040 --> 04:31.480
a lot of different screens, it's much easier to structure it this way than we.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.570
We know exactly where all of our screens are right in our or navigation.

04:37.720 --> 04:45.730
Of course, we created the nav host controller, but most importantly, if we go to our reader screens,

04:45.910 --> 04:50.950
right, this is where we added all of them to set them up that way.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.620
We we're able to use them whatever we want to use them.

04:54.580 --> 04:58.210
And again, as things grow, we can add as many screens as you want.

04:58.510 --> 05:01.060
You have just one place where we can go and get the screens.

05:01.480 --> 05:08.230
Obviously, as I said earlier, you could have just added the string names directly like that.

05:08.240 --> 05:15.970
But then that would mean every time you want to, for instance, go get our composable or change something

05:15.970 --> 05:21.640
here, we have to come here and write them and write the string ourself.

05:21.910 --> 05:22.210
OK.

05:22.450 --> 05:27.490
So having one place where we have all these string names in this casing that you know, it just helps

05:27.490 --> 05:29.520
immensely as you see, OK, very well.

05:29.530 --> 05:36.250
So we're able to at least get the navigation set up, which is really good, and we are now ready to

05:36.490 --> 05:39.130
move on and put together the actual splash screen.

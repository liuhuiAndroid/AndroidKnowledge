00:00.480 --> 00:05.760
All right, let's go ahead and look at this section here, where we can show a list of books that we've

00:05.760 --> 00:06.030
read.

00:06.310 --> 00:16.620
OK, so right after these two closing remarks there and we put another if statement if if you model

00:17.040 --> 00:17.820
that data.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.310
And value loading.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.960
It's true because I'm going to be loading some books here, then I'm going to say linear progress.

00:31.980 --> 00:40.710
Indicator show that else, then I'm just going to start putting together the info somewhere, put a

00:40.710 --> 00:49.860
divider first noticed this is going to be this divider there something nice and I'm going to add a lazy

00:49.950 --> 00:52.400
column, this lazy column.

00:52.400 --> 01:04.170
I'm going to play modifier to fight a fire feel max and then that feel height.

01:07.060 --> 01:07.420
This.

01:09.420 --> 01:17.940
And then I'm going to pack content padding values there for the content padding and with the padding

01:17.940 --> 01:26.400
values all about 16, so we're going to have these padding value for all the corners in Saturday's lazy

01:26.400 --> 01:26.790
column.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.890
There's one lambda here.

01:28.890 --> 01:33.060
We are going to filter again the books by finished.

01:33.060 --> 01:39.330
So I'm going to say filter books by finished ones.

01:40.110 --> 01:44.100
OK, so I see if I'll read books again.

01:45.030 --> 01:52.770
It's going to be a list containing am books objects when I do the same thing we did before anything

01:52.770 --> 01:53.030
new.

01:53.040 --> 02:00.150
Put it in sort of if statement here I'm going to check if our view model go to data, go through all

02:00.150 --> 02:07.860
of that value and get actual data is null or empty, if that's the case.

02:15.740 --> 02:16.520
Snot, no.

02:16.790 --> 02:25.090
So we have data I'm going to see if you modelled in data value data.

02:25.130 --> 02:29.480
I'm going to go ahead and filter again, so I and book.

02:35.140 --> 02:43.570
Like that, so I'm going to say and book check user ID again is equal to the current user.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.480
Heidi.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.360
And we're not sure that these are read, they're finished, right?

02:55.770 --> 02:56.490
It's not, no.

02:58.490 --> 03:04.490
Like this, so you need on the case, that's not true, then I'm just going to pass an empty list to

03:04.490 --> 03:05.570
our read books.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.040
All right.

03:07.610 --> 03:11.930
So once we have that set up, then I can invoke the items from.

03:13.630 --> 03:18.220
There and I want a list like this, I can pass items.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.010
It's going to be read books and we have passed lambda there.

03:21.010 --> 03:24.310
So this is where we're going to say Book Pro.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.720
Are we created before this book grow?

03:26.770 --> 03:27.610
How convenient.

03:28.090 --> 03:30.150
I'm going to just pass here.

03:30.160 --> 03:35.620
Our this is going to be, let's just say, book and pass her book.

03:36.130 --> 03:40.060
Now we're going to have a problem here because our book row expect a different type.

03:40.330 --> 03:45.630
It requires item book, which is the from our Jason right now.

03:45.670 --> 03:52.840
One thing I can do just for this one time I'm going to get this book composable.

03:53.230 --> 03:58.930
I just copy this and just add one here.

03:59.410 --> 04:05.440
Let's set everything OK instead of item, I'm going to say M book in this case.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.180
Lots of issues.

04:07.240 --> 04:11.740
OK, let's copy again and go here and paste it all in there.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.860
OK, we'll change this to M Book the type.

04:20.230 --> 04:21.070
Let's make sure we.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.280
Put all the things that need to be imported, that's fine.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.720
And this book row.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.070
This is what I'm going to be calling here.

04:30.090 --> 04:35.090
I'm going to say, Look, let's change this to stats.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.200
And where do you give that?

04:40.300 --> 04:41.770
And it will change all of that information.

04:41.830 --> 04:44.320
OK, so let's see.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.170
Copy this.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.960
OK, this has to be outside, let me.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.830
Looks like I'm making a mistake here, OK, let's cut all of this out.

05:01.220 --> 05:04.410
And put outside like that, OK, I think this will work, OK.

05:04.430 --> 05:04.720
There we go.

05:04.740 --> 05:07.490
Book starts now is being recognized.

05:07.500 --> 05:15.200
It can pass the book that book type and for now, let's go back to book stats.

05:16.610 --> 05:17.690
I don't want to do anything you.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.580
We're going to change because this is different.

05:19.590 --> 05:25.730
So book this book now to get images all with you.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.560
It's a book that.

05:29.070 --> 05:30.250
Photo URL.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.230
Like this?

05:32.820 --> 05:37.350
That to string is empty.

05:37.620 --> 05:42.300
Then we take that else, we're just going to go ahead and get to that book.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.040
Look, that photo are out.

05:45.880 --> 05:56.830
And not to string like that, and it's just going to change the title directly like that.

05:56.900 --> 06:02.410
And sure, we need to pass a few things so it's to string in the popular state.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.720
And the categories.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.490
And there we go.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.260
OK.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.620
A lot of restructuring here, that's a fair let's see what else are we missing?

06:14.670 --> 06:21.590
In this case, I'm not going to pass that because I don't want to go anywhere when these are clicks,

06:21.820 --> 06:23.400
I guess remove this altogether.

06:25.920 --> 06:32.340
OK, so let's save this and run should be able to see all the books this.

06:33.850 --> 06:34.720
User has read.

06:37.970 --> 06:44.780
OK, let's click, and while this book, this person has read one book, which makes sense if you go

06:44.780 --> 06:51.800
back and say This matters, read Update, we go back, we should see two books.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.990
OK, so the more books they read.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.030
And update.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.890
We can see now the they're not reading any books, right?

07:03.290 --> 07:04.120
They're saying they're.

07:04.690 --> 07:08.140
However, they have read three books and one two three.

07:09.280 --> 07:16.510
OK, so it is indeed working, this is wonderful, so you can go ahead and add a few books here, something

07:16.510 --> 07:17.290
is loading.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.160
David, go what took a little while?

07:19.570 --> 07:20.410
Get that book!

07:20.500 --> 07:22.870
Looks like the internet is not the best at this point.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.820
So the same books that search for something else eating pasta?

07:29.290 --> 07:30.370
OK, there you go.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.110
Internet is really slow, but there it is.

07:34.210 --> 07:36.300
The books are showing an endless load.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.150
OK, I'm going go ahead and save.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.380
Go back.

07:43.770 --> 07:44.050
Voila!

07:44.250 --> 07:47.130
So books are being added, I can go ahead and add.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.010
Here, Mark started.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.290
And he can see we're reading this book and I can go and change.

07:56.430 --> 07:59.500
Say Mark, updates done.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.080
And voila!

08:01.350 --> 08:06.570
So we're able to really get this app to work Friend lives in does exactly what we wanted to do.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.130
Wonderful.

08:08.370 --> 08:09.460
Congratulations.

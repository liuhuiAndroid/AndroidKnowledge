00:00.510 --> 00:05.310
Next, we're going to look at this meter, right score meter, as you see here, so the idea is that

00:05.760 --> 00:09.870
we're going to have this pill like structure.

00:10.080 --> 00:18.690
And inside we're going to have a linear gradient that will that will be filling up as we get our questions

00:19.170 --> 00:19.650
answered.

00:19.990 --> 00:26.730
OK, so it's very simple and at the end is going to show the actual score as we get our answers correct.

00:27.150 --> 00:30.270
So instead of questions here what it can do.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.790
Let me close this down.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.560
So we have more space.

00:36.730 --> 00:38.140
We're going to create another composable.

00:40.020 --> 00:41.400
I preview first.

00:46.160 --> 00:54.890
And then when I call this show progress and I'll have to pass a score, it's going to be an inch.

00:55.310 --> 00:58.550
And for now, it's going to be 12, just so we have something.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.270
And then here I'm going to create a row.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.350
And pass the modifier.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900
You a general pattern of three deep.

01:19.500 --> 01:28.230
And, Phil, my max width as well as height, I'm just going to give it about 45 deep, so I'm putting

01:28.230 --> 01:29.970
together this structure here first.

01:29.970 --> 01:32.270
It's going to just have a row inside of it.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.480
I'm going to add other items.

01:33.810 --> 01:35.610
OK, OK.

01:35.610 --> 01:46.050
So next, I'm going to actually save border the width of this border, let's say four deep and I'm going

01:46.050 --> 01:47.610
to add a brush.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.440
So again.

01:55.730 --> 02:02.030
I want to now put together this structure here, this border, just like we did before here I.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.180
And so I say brush linear gradient.

02:07.210 --> 02:12.820
There are different kinds of gradients, but we use linear and we have has two colors here.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.040
It's going to be a list of colors, a list of.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.710
And we're past the colors.

02:17.990 --> 02:19.720
Well, nothing very exciting here.

02:19.730 --> 02:29.440
I'm going to go with colors when I use the same and light purple and again and light purple like this.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.090
OK, so I'm using the same colors.

02:34.310 --> 02:41.150
This pasta shape, and I'm going to say rounded corners, shape, it's going to be about 34 dpi.

02:41.690 --> 02:42.560
All corners.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.140
All right.

02:45.140 --> 02:51.290
I'm going to say that clip clip the shape is going to be rounded corners shape.

02:52.370 --> 02:58.940
So top start percent is going to be 50 so rounder than usual.

03:00.710 --> 03:03.660
And so the same thing we did before.

03:03.740 --> 03:06.020
Nothing should be surprising here.

03:06.020 --> 03:13.370
Bottom two percent then let's give a background and say color that transparent.

03:16.420 --> 03:19.090
Continue here still, instead of our row, by the way.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.910
Let's give a vertical alignment.

03:26.170 --> 03:28.230
A line, a center of vertically.

03:31.010 --> 03:31.430
All right.

03:34.290 --> 03:34.680
OK.

03:34.740 --> 03:37.500
There is you can see we have the structure.

03:38.040 --> 03:44.880
So what we need to do next is to make it so that inside now we're going to have we are going to have

03:44.880 --> 03:47.640
this gradient that will dynamically grow.

03:48.150 --> 03:52.740
OK, so what I'm going to use because I want to make sure that it looks exactly like this, which means

03:52.740 --> 03:58.470
it's going to be inside who will look like it's inside of this pill like structure user interface.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.040
OK.

03:59.610 --> 04:05.520
So I figured the best way to do this actually will be to use a button because a button will have all

04:05.520 --> 04:08.190
the properties that I want, even though I don't want to click event.

04:08.520 --> 04:13.590
But it will have this round corner, which I can't use, and then I'm going to restructure two button

04:13.590 --> 04:13.980
side.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.360
So it looks something like that.

04:16.270 --> 04:16.530
OK.

04:18.450 --> 04:20.040
It's just a design choice.

04:20.550 --> 04:20.970
All right.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.300
So inside of our row here, I'm going to say Button don't need to pass anything, you know, click so

04:28.380 --> 04:29.100
it content.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.240
Content padding.

04:32.860 --> 04:38.070
And we'll say padding values and parts in this gear, just one that deep.

04:39.070 --> 04:44.340
So if you have it over here, it's going to say when we pass it content padding, that means the content

04:44.340 --> 04:49.420
inside is going to create a padding of all along, all four edges.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.520
So that's what we need.

04:51.700 --> 04:57.760
You will see later because we are trying to create something inside that will look very natural inside

04:57.760 --> 05:00.010
of our pill like structure there.

05:00.820 --> 05:01.120
OK.

05:01.180 --> 05:07.300
Let's add modifier fill max with this point that was going to live right as it is.

05:07.750 --> 05:11.680
And the background color when it is brush.

05:12.340 --> 05:14.920
And in this case, I'm going to have to pass a gradient.

05:15.640 --> 05:20.290
The reason why, as I see this is the idea, is that we're going to have this very nice gradient of

05:20.290 --> 05:22.570
that color kind of pink to purple.

05:23.740 --> 05:29.920
Now, I could pass the grade in here, but I'm going to create a vowel outside so we can for it, I

05:29.920 --> 05:32.320
say vowel gradient.

05:36.160 --> 05:44.840
Can you use a brush and linear gradient in this case, going to pass the list of colors?

05:45.790 --> 05:53.170
And I have already these colors when I just talked about what color the first color is going to be zero

05:53.170 --> 05:53.650
x.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.790
F f you to pass the f because that is the alpha.

05:59.230 --> 06:01.240
The opacity or transparency of the color.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.990
Then I'm going to say this long.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.780
75 like this.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.800
And then pass another color.

06:15.190 --> 06:17.740
This has to be color and colors.

06:18.130 --> 06:19.110
All right, there we go.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.500
So now I have migrating here, so it's going to be, as you can see, there are the colors are showing

06:23.500 --> 06:28.330
here, this kind of pink tuchus, I would say light purple.

06:29.350 --> 06:35.680
So that gradient is going to be passed right here now because we're using a button and button has many

06:35.680 --> 06:37.060
other properties we have over.

06:37.060 --> 06:42.730
For instance, you will see it has content padding, which we added border shapes, elevation and traction

06:42.730 --> 06:44.890
enables and many other things.

06:45.370 --> 06:49.990
The other thing I want to do is, for instance, I want to make sure that this button is enabled to

06:49.990 --> 06:52.330
false because I don't want this to be clickable.

06:53.200 --> 07:03.010
So after our brush here or background, I can go ahead and say enabled to follow because clickable and

07:03.010 --> 07:09.040
elevation, I'm going to just give and null because I don't want to show any material elevation at all.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.000
All right.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.790
And then I'm going to change the colors because buttons have certain colors, like when they're on the

07:14.800 --> 07:15.700
clipped and so forth.

07:15.700 --> 07:21.850
So we want to kind of turn that off everything off so that we just have a structure like this.

07:22.420 --> 07:29.140
So I'm going to use buttons, button colors I see go ahead and import that.

07:35.450 --> 07:36.620
And for the background.

07:38.890 --> 07:46.090
Once they color that transparent, get rid of all of that and disabled the green color at all, it's

07:46.090 --> 07:47.830
going to be color, not transparent.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.180
Let's take a look.

07:51.030 --> 07:51.540
All right.

07:51.690 --> 07:52.270
Very good.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.280
It's looking really good.

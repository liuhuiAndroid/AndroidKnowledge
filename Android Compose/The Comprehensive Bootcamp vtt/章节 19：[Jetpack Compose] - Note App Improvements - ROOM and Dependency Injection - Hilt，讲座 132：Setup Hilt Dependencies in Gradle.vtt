00:00.570 --> 00:03.150
So let's go ahead and set up a hilt and dagger.

00:03.540 --> 00:10.220
So opening our project jet note, what are we going to do is let's go to our Gradle scripts there.

00:10.230 --> 00:17.160
We get the first one build like process project there, and we need to add a few things the first thing

00:17.160 --> 00:19.110
in 08 extant extension here.

00:19.140 --> 00:19.470
Right.

00:20.430 --> 00:26.370
I'm going to say helped underscore version and give it a value.

00:27.090 --> 00:34.260
So as the recording this video, so as a recording this lesson right now, the version is to die at

00:34.980 --> 00:36.630
thirty nine.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.540
At the time of this recording hild version is to that.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.100
39.

00:40.350 --> 00:44.310
OK, by the time you may be watching this video, it may be higher.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.450
So keep that in mind.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.310
All right, so we have these hill version that is going to be used in a second here.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.730
So right about here, all seats are for dependencies.

00:53.730 --> 00:58.470
I'm going to add another class here class path and exit class path like that.

01:02.350 --> 01:11.350
And I am going to write to the following I say, calm that Google, that dagger exactly as such and

01:11.350 --> 01:23.830
then Colin say Hilt Bash, Android Gradle plugin and then I can say here.

01:28.890 --> 01:34.950
Hilt version like that, so it's going to go ahead and pull this version that we added, they revealed.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.980
Now you may ask, So where do I get this information?

01:37.980 --> 01:39.480
How do I know what to type here?

01:39.510 --> 01:45.840
Well, well, if you go to Google and type Android hilt like this, you will get most likely the first

01:45.840 --> 01:46.440
page here.

01:46.630 --> 01:47.580
OK, so click on that.

01:47.730 --> 01:49.560
That's from developer that Android.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.030
And here we are.

01:51.600 --> 01:57.060
So here says dependency injection with health, so we can actually read more about Hild and how to use

01:57.060 --> 01:57.210
it.

01:57.690 --> 02:00.300
But most importantly, if you scroll down, it's going to tell you here.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.330
So it will tell you exactly what you need to pass.

02:03.630 --> 02:08.640
So it says here in our build script dependencies, you will have to add this class paths.

02:08.650 --> 02:09.940
In fact, again, a copy that.

02:09.960 --> 02:13.550
That's exactly what we have to our dependencies.

02:13.560 --> 02:20.770
Make sure we are inside of this first build that gradle, the project there, and it's going to be exactly

02:20.770 --> 02:21.120
the same.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.650
What I've added, I'm just going to show you.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.170
So as you can see, it says something like that.

02:25.500 --> 02:29.280
If you copy and paste from there, this is a squiggly line.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.820
You're going to get to say this is not the correct version or there is a newer version.

02:32.820 --> 02:37.530
So what you can do can either click there and say change two two three nine like this?

02:37.770 --> 02:41.340
So I just want to show you where I get these dependencies.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.070
OK, so this is the same thing as what we have here.

02:44.310 --> 02:48.960
It's just that I put the hild version at the top here, so I can call it.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.090
All right.

02:50.730 --> 02:51.120
Very good.

02:52.860 --> 02:57.430
So coming back again, you can scroll down and there's other things we need to do.

02:57.450 --> 03:02.200
You noticed that a type of uses plugins, so we need to also pass if you plug ins.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.570
These two have to be passed.

03:03.570 --> 03:11.610
So I'm going to copy these like that and make sure it says here, then apply the Gradle plugin and add

03:11.610 --> 03:12.930
these dependency in your app.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.040
Build that Gradle.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.050
So I need to go to our app.

03:19.860 --> 03:26.280
So this one here, jedno, that app double click and at the top, you could see something like this.

03:26.610 --> 03:29.610
So I'm going to add that inside those too.

03:30.600 --> 03:30.960
All right.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.690
Let's go back and see what else can we do?

03:35.900 --> 03:40.070
There get so next thing we need to do is to go ahead and sink our project.

03:41.930 --> 03:47.690
OK, so when you think you may have this problem, says the hilt Android Gradle plugin is applied,

03:47.810 --> 03:52.460
but no come Google Dagger hilt dependency was found.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.270
What does that mean?

03:53.330 --> 03:54.200
We missed something.

03:54.410 --> 03:59.780
Let's go back to our help here, says we added this plugins.

03:59.780 --> 04:00.380
Wonderful.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.380
However, we forgot to add these other dependencies here.

04:03.770 --> 04:12.470
So what I need to do is copy all of this to here copy and I'm going to go down here where it says dependencies.

04:13.630 --> 04:20.470
So anywhere around here, what I like to do usually is I like to add comment, say hilt.

04:23.330 --> 04:28.460
Dagger like this or I know the dependencies that I'm adding right there we have it, so now it's going

04:28.460 --> 04:30.680
to say, OK, something is now right change to.

04:32.390 --> 04:36.220
Now you notice here there's a version is the same because it's hilt, right?

04:36.230 --> 04:39.910
It's the same as the version that we created earlier, right?

04:40.130 --> 04:44.900
So it can actually invoke the hilt and the score version here.

04:47.410 --> 04:47.630
Right.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.690
Because we've added skilled version.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.910
There, so I can't invoke that.

04:53.970 --> 04:57.690
It's much easier, so I have one place where I have everything there.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.700
OK, the same thing I can do here.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.890
Held a version like this, in fact, it completes for you as well.

05:06.570 --> 05:14.010
OK, that's another step, so it's important to follow these steps as they show here, because otherwise

05:14.310 --> 05:16.680
you may end up running into issues as you saw.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.980
So now we're ready to try again or sink.

05:21.830 --> 05:27.680
OK, this looks like everything went well and no errors, so that's good, so we have now set up all

05:27.680 --> 05:31.400
the dependencies that we need so that we can actually start using health.

WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:06.000
So when we go to details here, we're going to add the actual top bar as well, so that would look something

00:06.000 --> 00:12.030
like this, and we're going to add a an arrow to signify that the users can tap on that and go back.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.240
So just to make our app uniform, right?

00:15.240 --> 00:17.520
So to do that, let's go to our details.

00:18.360 --> 00:24.420
What I'm going to do instead of having all of this, I'm just going to let's go ahead and comment all

00:24.420 --> 00:29.400
of this out first so we can get some of the pieces that we may need later.

00:29.460 --> 00:29.790
OK.

00:30.450 --> 00:34.610
So the first thing I want to add here is going to be a scaffold.

00:35.290 --> 00:35.550
Right?

00:36.480 --> 00:39.420
That structure, that's the scaffold.

00:39.540 --> 00:45.150
Remember the structure that we have, the material structure that allows us to create a uniform user

00:45.150 --> 00:45.570
interface.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.510
OK, so set top bar.

00:51.570 --> 00:56.070
Right for a top bottom and just to use the top bars, and we have.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.960
And let's go back to home.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.750
Essentially, I'm going to borrow all of this.

01:03.770 --> 01:04.640
Let's see.

01:08.450 --> 01:13.060
In fact, this column agenda is a little bit too aggressive, let's just use something else.

01:14.610 --> 01:16.050
She's like, great for now.

01:19.090 --> 01:21.280
Let's just get right.

01:28.230 --> 01:35.760
OK, so in here, I'm actually going to create a row.

01:36.570 --> 01:45.600
The next thing I want to add here is going to be an icon, so say icon like this and to use the image

01:45.600 --> 01:55.320
factor, I'd say icons that default and save arrow back description.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.280
Just say Arrow.

01:59.260 --> 02:06.700
Back such then, I'm going to put a modifier here because I want to make this clickable, so I'm going

02:06.700 --> 02:13.150
to say modifier fire, clickable like this, and when it's clicked, that's when I'm going to add some

02:13.150 --> 02:13.880
information here.

02:13.900 --> 02:14.230
OK.

02:14.950 --> 02:15.300
All right.

02:15.310 --> 02:16.210
So there we go.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.650
When we click, we want to go back.

02:17.650 --> 02:19.060
So we have the nav.

02:19.060 --> 02:21.060
So let's go back in just code.

02:21.130 --> 02:25.370
Same thing that we did before pop back like this, right?

02:25.390 --> 02:26.140
When that clicked.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.060
And for our role, I'm going to say my alignment.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.190
I want horizontal arrangement.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.170
You want to start.

02:42.010 --> 02:43.840
Everything has to be to the left.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.230
And so here I'm going to put a space there because.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.350
I want to make sure that the movie title there.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.360
He's about 100 are deep, so to push this movie to the right.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.460
OK, let's see what else.

03:03.490 --> 03:03.850
All right.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.560
Right inside here.

03:05.570 --> 03:06.610
This is our content.

03:06.730 --> 03:10.420
This is where I can go back and put that text that we have.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.410
Or actually just put a Texas says.

03:16.140 --> 03:19.710
Our movie data is essentially what we had before here.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.780
Just copy this.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.380
OK, let's go ahead and run this.

03:28.020 --> 03:34.200
Great, they were going to say click and while the avatar we can click now that arrow, we want to take

03:34.200 --> 03:36.050
him back again.

03:38.310 --> 03:44.220
Obviously, we can just put all of this back right at the surface if we want inside of our.

03:47.730 --> 03:48.600
Body here.

03:48.960 --> 03:53.340
Just get rid of that one comment at all.

03:56.210 --> 03:57.800
OK, here we go.

03:58.550 --> 03:59.420
Let's go ahead and run.

04:01.340 --> 04:05.390
All right, there you go, you can see we still have back, we don't want that back, of course, so

04:05.390 --> 04:10.850
can get rid of this button altogether because everything is only set up for us.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.080
Let's make it all look nicer.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.130
Let's go ahead and run.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.610
So now we're just setting things up here.

04:21.630 --> 04:22.160
Nothing, really.

04:22.170 --> 04:22.620
No.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.360
OK, there we go.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.950
So everything is working.

04:25.950 --> 04:30.450
So now we have this very nice uniform user interface.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.400
So we click, you know, stellar, get in our style.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.350
I can go back.

04:34.920 --> 04:35.790
And there you have it.

04:36.360 --> 04:36.630
OK.

04:36.900 --> 04:41.070
Of course, you can work around, make this even better look good.

04:41.070 --> 04:44.310
But we will get there so we can change the color if you want.

04:44.310 --> 04:53.280
We can just see color just transparent so that it doesn't have any background color procedures transparent.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.120
There we go.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.960
So it's movies go.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.380
Of course, in our details, we haven't changed and it's still the same.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.690
OK, we can play around with everything we want.

05:04.020 --> 05:09.630
And also the other thing we can do, you know, top body, if I have over, you can say, for instance,

05:09.630 --> 05:17.250
elevation for elevation, I can't say zero dpi, so no elevation whatsoever.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.750
And now we should see just white.

05:23.580 --> 05:23.890
OK.

05:24.090 --> 05:24.690
It's very nice.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.910
So you can play around into all sort of things.

05:27.240 --> 05:35.070
And of course, we're going to keep working here and I can do the same thing tour details if it's zero

05:35.070 --> 05:36.000
elevation.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.890
Color transparent.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.960
Now we have something uniform.

05:51.950 --> 05:52.850
OK, there we go.

05:53.090 --> 05:53.990
And we have that.

05:54.380 --> 05:54.680
All right.

05:54.830 --> 05:57.580
Just options, and we may change that later.

05:57.590 --> 06:03.830
But the most important thing here is that we were able to put together a very simple application well

06:03.920 --> 06:12.410
to look at how to structure our app and how to navigate between screens using the navigation component,

06:12.410 --> 06:16.640
which is really, really important and very useful, as you can see here, right?

06:16.700 --> 06:23.090
So we are going to continue working on this movie app, right, and displaying movies here and perhaps

06:23.090 --> 06:29.210
make this even better by creating a data class which will have more properties that we can then add

06:29.510 --> 06:30.830
to our details here.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.660
OK, congratulations.

06:33.080 --> 06:33.920
And I'll see you next.

WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:05.170
Let's go ahead and get some real data and get some images and make it a little better.

00:06.100 --> 00:06.910
Let's go ahead and do this.

00:07.450 --> 00:13.270
Well, first of all, we are going to represent each movie as an object as things are right now, if

00:13.270 --> 00:14.200
you go to home screen.

00:14.650 --> 00:15.490
What are we doing here?

00:15.490 --> 00:19.480
We just passing this list of of strings.

00:19.750 --> 00:20.590
We're going to change that.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.400
So let's go back to our package.

00:25.420 --> 00:28.330
I'm going to right click create a new package.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.260
Model inside here.

00:31.270 --> 00:34.910
I'm going to create a new data class.

00:34.920 --> 00:42.040
So I'm going to create a codling in class and we need a data class, right, that you just will because

00:42.040 --> 00:43.990
this will just represent data.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.480
So when I call this movie section.

00:47.770 --> 00:49.870
So a movie will have an ID.

00:50.590 --> 00:54.370
He's going to be a string and then we'll have a title,

00:58.030 --> 00:59.620
which is also going to be a string.

01:01.980 --> 01:10.410
Yea, that was released the screen and genre, which is also going to be a strange

01:12.780 --> 01:26.040
director starring actors screen and the plot of the movie also streaming, so I'm just creating a few

01:26.040 --> 01:37.950
properties here and poster, which is going to be a strain as well, and vile images.

01:38.970 --> 01:42.670
It's going to be a list of string costume.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.040
Those will be your owls.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.620
And let's just front lines of with the rating.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.060
Also a string section.

01:51.420 --> 01:57.630
All right, now all of this data, we're going to be getting pieces of it actually from a film that

01:57.630 --> 01:59.510
Jason filed that I found online.

01:59.600 --> 02:04.820
Okay, so you will have access to this so you can take a look and see, right?

02:04.890 --> 02:09.210
But really, the way things are going to be set up, you won't really need this.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.760
But I will include in a way that way, you just have an idea.

02:12.210 --> 02:19.500
So what this is is a JSON file, which is a format used, used to represent data as object.

02:19.740 --> 02:24.110
OK, so we have an array or list containing objects that look like this.

02:24.110 --> 02:27.120
So each one of these is going to be a movie.

02:27.690 --> 02:35.460
So as an object or in this case, a class will have a title, a movie, one movie, a movie has a title

02:35.460 --> 02:35.790
here.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.140
Read it In so many other.

02:37.650 --> 02:42.480
This is what I am modelling from our movie class.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.240
They're OK with a few changes, of course.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.200
So this is what we're doing.

02:46.650 --> 02:51.190
So I'm going to extract all of this data and put in a list, right manually.

02:51.510 --> 02:55.590
And then we're going to be able to use this as our data source for this app.

02:56.130 --> 02:56.520
OK.

02:56.590 --> 03:04.290
So that's what we're doing now because we are not getting this information, this data movie data from

03:04.290 --> 03:05.820
anywhere else but locally.

03:06.150 --> 03:12.780
And it's just dummy data per say, I'm going to create a function here called get movies, OK because

03:12.780 --> 03:14.520
we're just getting something in this.

03:14.520 --> 03:20.820
In this case here, this will return a list of movie objects like this movie there?

03:23.560 --> 03:23.870
OK.

03:24.070 --> 03:24.550
There it is.

03:24.910 --> 03:31.720
And I must say return, I'm going to return a list of and I'm going to pass all the elements here.

03:31.810 --> 03:36.040
So here I'm going to go ahead and create a movie, a few movies, actually.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.880
So I'm going to say something like this movie and I'll have to pass it.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.610
Has the title and so forth.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.830
Now I already have created all of this.

03:45.190 --> 03:51.070
And so you should have you will have access to these objects, movie objects so that you know, that

03:51.070 --> 03:54.320
way you won't have to watch me type hour of editing.

03:54.340 --> 03:59.610
Now you can see, you can see now get movies will be returning movie objects.

03:59.620 --> 04:05.070
So each movie has an ID title year, Akshara director and so forth.

04:05.080 --> 04:12.530
And of course, Images lists the list of URLs containing images of the movie and so forth.

04:12.530 --> 04:17.230
So this is all going to be using to populate our user interface.

04:18.310 --> 04:18.730
All right.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.710
Now that we have that, let's go to our home and instead of passing a list of strings, what I'm going

04:26.710 --> 04:27.070
to do.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.710
Let's change this to say list of movies.

04:31.930 --> 04:35.760
Like a movie like this, we're going to have a problem, so we're going to have to get rid of all of

04:35.760 --> 04:36.020
this.

04:36.020 --> 04:40.440
So I'm just going to go ahead and delete this list.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.950
And he I'm just going to say get movies as such.

04:44.340 --> 04:44.670
All right.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.980
Now we're going to have another problem here because the movie row is expecting a string, right?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.260
So let's go to movie row.

04:52.860 --> 05:01.650
And here I'm going to just say this will be a movie object like that, and I'm going to have an issue

05:01.650 --> 05:02.010
here.

05:02.460 --> 05:07.440
And because on click what we want to do is want to be able to get the ad.

05:07.560 --> 05:13.830
Someone say that I'd hate to invoke that ad. We're going to need that to then get the information.

05:15.180 --> 05:15.450
All right.

05:15.450 --> 05:21.330
So this text here, of course, a movie now is just an object actually is an object like just an object.

05:21.690 --> 05:26.280
Let's just say for this text I'm going to say won the title that I want to show here.

05:26.280 --> 05:30.720
So I'm invoking the properties of our object very well.

05:31.080 --> 05:36.010
Now the other thing you will notice is that the movie row is inside of main activity.

05:36.030 --> 05:36.990
This is not good.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.860
So what are we going to do, actually?

05:38.890 --> 05:43.890
Usually, what we want to do is to create another package.

05:44.460 --> 05:46.750
In this package, we can call widgets.

05:46.770 --> 05:53.320
So this is where we add all the pieces of information in this case, all the pieces of the UI, all

05:53.320 --> 05:55.080
of the composable, smaller, composable.

05:55.410 --> 05:55.680
OK.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.700
So then I'm going to just cut all of this.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.950
In fact, before I do that.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.890
Let me create a new file.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.970
It's going to be just a file and call this.

06:10.930 --> 06:11.620
Widgets.

06:14.540 --> 06:22.450
Like this because we can put more than one widget, OK, and then we're going to get all of this going

06:22.460 --> 06:27.350
to just select all people in there.

06:28.790 --> 06:32.360
Right now, remain will most likely.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.710
And there you have it.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.490
OK, so now we have the widget, there is then being used anywhere.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.050
Well, it's being used here.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.040
So let's go ahead to and import our movie row.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.870
And let's see a movie that's good.

06:48.890 --> 06:51.980
Looks like we haven't had a problem, yes, we need to get rid of this import.

06:52.430 --> 06:53.990
That's old one old news.

06:54.950 --> 06:57.050
OK, so now what are we going to do?

06:57.080 --> 06:58.850
Let's go ahead and run and see what's going to happen.

06:59.600 --> 07:07.710
We should be able to get the correct information actually from our from our data database per se right

07:07.730 --> 07:08.390
to get movies.

07:09.020 --> 07:14.960
Now, if I click here, I'm going to go and get now the ID, because that's what we said.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.160
We were going to be passing the ID.

07:17.270 --> 07:23.450
So each movie, if we go back to our movie, we added this unique ID.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.690
This is important, as you will see later.

07:27.470 --> 07:32.990
Next, we're going to revamp each one of these rows to look a little bit better than this.

Now, because we need to gather data from somewhere, it is going to be a trivia app.

00:05.340 --> 00:09.720
I found this Jason that is hosted at this link.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.350
Here I can.

00:10.650 --> 00:11.850
I'll give you the.

00:12.120 --> 00:16.740
You'll have access to this link and you can see here is a JSON payload.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.870
So we have here.

00:20.660 --> 00:26.030
So we have here at the beginning, a square bracket there, which means this is going to be a list and

00:26.240 --> 00:28.100
inside of each list we have objects.

00:28.100 --> 00:32.120
So this would constitute, of course, the first item.

00:32.210 --> 00:32.510
Right.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.650
So there is a question.

00:33.770 --> 00:35.990
The first object, if you close here, right?

00:36.170 --> 00:36.680
There it is.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.510
So there are a lot of information.

00:38.510 --> 00:43.250
There's this list contains a lot of questions or previous, if you will.

00:43.670 --> 00:48.470
So we have a question and then we have the category and we have the answer, right?

00:49.100 --> 00:55.190
So the choices then are also hosted inside of another.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.320
List, yes.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.840
True or false or false or true, as you see.

01:00.150 --> 01:02.720
And so the answer here, the field says true.

01:02.780 --> 01:04.230
That means that the question is true.

01:04.250 --> 01:10.250
So if the user in this case, as we build their application, it's true, then they will have answered

01:10.250 --> 01:11.780
true quite correctly.

01:12.350 --> 01:16.280
So this is the structure of each one of our question, right?

01:17.180 --> 01:18.140
So this is the question.

01:18.470 --> 01:23.210
And of course, we have category this is just for the application if we wish to use categories because

01:23.210 --> 01:25.430
each section could have different categories.

01:25.430 --> 01:29.810
But we're just going to simplify everything when I we're not going to use this category, but in any

01:29.810 --> 01:33.770
case, we can use, if you want to do and then we have the answer is going to be Louisiana.

01:33.770 --> 01:39.620
Of course, if and of course, then the users are given all these choices to choose from, just like

01:39.620 --> 01:41.390
we saw in our demo.

01:41.990 --> 01:44.240
So this is the payload Jason payload.

01:44.540 --> 01:53.000
We're going to be able we are going to pass this data from this link and then construct an actual trivia

01:53.000 --> 01:55.970
question and show to the user all the options.

01:55.970 --> 02:01.340
And then when the user picks the correct or the wrong answer, we let them know and we move forward.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.760
So that's the essence of this trivia app.

02:04.970 --> 02:10.730
So next to what we're going to be doing is we are going to look at creating the actual model class,

02:10.790 --> 02:16.580
which will model after this JSON payload that we have that set up.

02:16.880 --> 02:21.380
OK, so we're going to start from the back, meaning we are going to start from putting together the

02:21.380 --> 02:24.920
data layer and then go to the user interface.

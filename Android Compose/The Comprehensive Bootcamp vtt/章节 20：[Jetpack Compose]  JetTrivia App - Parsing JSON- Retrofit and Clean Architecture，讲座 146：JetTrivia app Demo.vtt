00:00.330 --> 00:04.410
All right, so in this section, we are going to build a jet trivia app.

00:04.770 --> 00:07.380
So this application will look something like this.

00:07.590 --> 00:11.050
It's very simple, but most importantly, we're going to be learning a few things.

00:11.050 --> 00:15.600
So we're going to start learning about clean architecture, at least the introduction, what it means

00:15.870 --> 00:18.120
and how to structure app in such a manner.

00:18.660 --> 00:26.160
We're also going to learn how to pass the JASON using Retrofit, which is a library that abstracts out

00:26.160 --> 00:33.090
all the heart aches, all of the things that one needs to do in order to pass Jason apps from the web.

00:33.420 --> 00:33.690
OK.

00:33.750 --> 00:37.860
And of course, we are going to continue learning about UI design in compose.

00:38.070 --> 00:42.570
So as always, we are going to introduce new things as we build an app.

00:43.230 --> 00:46.890
So this is what we are going to be building a trivia application.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.470
Let me give you a quick demo of the app.

00:50.390 --> 00:57.320
So here's a quick demo of the app here, so as we go through the app, as we answer the questions we

00:57.320 --> 01:00.740
are, we are immediately pulled into the next question.

01:00.740 --> 01:05.810
So here here have Question two out of four thousand eight hundred seventy five questions about a lot

01:05.810 --> 01:06.320
of questions.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.360
So so you can see the layout here.

01:08.360 --> 01:14.090
We have the actual question or the actual statement that we could be true or false, and we have the

01:14.090 --> 01:15.530
options at the bottom here, OK?

01:16.130 --> 01:18.740
All of this is coming in from a JSON file.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.850
So in this case, if I say next, if I select what I selected, then that works.

01:23.270 --> 01:27.920
And let's say true, well, that's great and can see.

01:28.100 --> 01:34.280
Also, at certain point, I start having this meter that is showing that it's very small.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.170
So as I get the answers correct, looks like I'm real good at this.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.890
You can see that that meter is changing.

01:43.160 --> 01:43.610
OK.

01:43.910 --> 01:47.440
This is because I've worked on this, so I know this is wrong.

01:47.450 --> 01:50.870
You can see it has this red color to say This is wrong.

01:51.830 --> 01:52.130
I can't.

01:52.130 --> 01:52.550
I wa.

01:52.550 --> 01:59.510
Perhaps there we go and we can continue in as our meter shows.

01:59.510 --> 02:05.210
Here are the certain at certain point we're going to start seeing the actual score of the game.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.100
This is what we are going to be building.

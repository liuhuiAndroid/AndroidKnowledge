WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:08.190
What we really want to happen is this sense of as we are getting the questions right, this will grow

00:08.970 --> 00:12.750
right because we wanted to show like this right away, how do we do that?

00:13.380 --> 00:19.500
Well, we understand that the width of this button, which it is a button because we just use it and

00:19.500 --> 00:21.570
transformed it into something like that, OK?

00:22.140 --> 00:25.530
The width of it here, it says, fill max width.

00:25.590 --> 00:31.470
Well, what we want to do is we want to have some sort of a factory progress factory we can multiply

00:31.470 --> 00:31.920
by.

00:32.340 --> 00:39.150
And as we progress in our question answering our trivia, we want to grow that factor.

00:39.450 --> 00:45.000
Because remember in our film max here for how over we can pass the fraction, which is the float that

00:45.000 --> 00:53.130
is multiplied by, it's just a multiplier that will affect the size or the width of the entire button.

00:53.880 --> 01:02.250
Because look, if I pass here, let's say I wanted 30 percent to 0.3 f like this, what's going to happen

01:02.250 --> 01:02.410
now?

01:02.410 --> 01:03.990
We're going to see this is going to be smaller.

01:04.470 --> 01:05.840
The contents inside, right?

01:05.850 --> 01:06.720
The gradient.

01:07.920 --> 01:08.310
Voila!

01:08.610 --> 01:09.750
There you go, you can see that.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.320
So we are going to use that to our advantage.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.150
But then you will realize the thing has to come to mind is that we have to have some sort of state,

01:18.840 --> 01:25.770
right, so that as we click and say yes or select the correct answers and we go to the next question.

01:26.130 --> 01:27.750
This also has to be growing.

01:29.000 --> 01:29.540
Makes sense.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.710
So can create another foul here.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.850
We call Progress Factor.

01:39.050 --> 01:45.350
It's going to be a remember and it's going to be driven by in this case, I'm going to have to pass

01:45.350 --> 01:51.020
here the score value that we get because it is that as we increment the score, we're going to multiply

01:51.080 --> 01:54.890
that by a certain factor so we can see this progress.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.650
So here you can use any factory you want.

01:57.650 --> 02:04.970
But I found that this very tiny factor is probably the best because the smaller the factor, the more

02:04.970 --> 02:13.250
opportunities we're going to have to actually get this filled out by the time we finish with 4800 for

02:13.260 --> 02:15.080
the 800 plus questions.

02:15.390 --> 02:21.470
OK, so you can play around with this multiplier here, I'm going to say zero zero zero eight zero zero

02:21.470 --> 02:22.370
five.

02:23.420 --> 02:29.000
Affleck this actually my batch is going to be a score that's going to happen inside here.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.500
So I see mutable state.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.650
Of the value is going to be score.

02:35.850 --> 02:41.100
Multiply that by zero nine zero zero five f like this?

02:43.320 --> 02:48.750
And then it is progress factor that is what are we going to pass inside of our width?

02:50.920 --> 02:52.260
The side of this button with.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.370
That value.

02:56.540 --> 03:02.420
Remember, we can always say buy like this also have to import a few things.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.930
Like that, so that way, we don't have to go and say, I get value like that.

03:09.970 --> 03:12.530
OK, so this is just a preference, as we have seen before.

03:13.250 --> 03:18.840
So because the multiplier is really small, if air refreshes refresh this, it's not going to show anything.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.450
What's going to be really, really small?

03:21.140 --> 03:25.250
Actually, you can see a little bit, but once we put into our app, it should be very small.

03:25.280 --> 03:25.580
OK.

03:26.420 --> 03:27.380
There you have it.

03:27.680 --> 03:34.130
Now let's see if this we can add this to our main question display.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.110
So let's open up this again.

03:37.670 --> 03:39.170
So where are we going to add that?

03:39.440 --> 03:45.980
Well, we're going to add that at the top of our question question and out of there, right?

03:46.640 --> 03:47.460
But what are we going to do?

03:47.480 --> 03:50.780
Also, we want to put an if statement because people want to show it right away.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.870
We want to show it the moment they get to a certain level.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.390
OK, so let's come up here.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.160
So we have the question tracker right here.

04:03.780 --> 04:07.320
Before that, I'm going to put an if statement they will say.

04:09.250 --> 04:18.260
The question index, not value is greater or equal to three I.

04:20.140 --> 04:26.890
Then we're going to just show the progress, so we're going to wait for a bit until, ah, we have more

04:26.890 --> 04:28.630
than three questions answered.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.630
And for a score here, I'm going to score.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.380
I'm going to just going to say question that value.

04:36.920 --> 04:37.880
Question index.

04:40.060 --> 04:40.940
Get the value.

04:41.600 --> 04:47.570
So we're going to count the score by passing just the question index versus zero and as they continue.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.610
We're going to increment one and so forth.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.830
And again, you can change this to your liking, but this works for me.

04:55.550 --> 04:55.900
All right.

04:55.910 --> 04:59.090
Let's go ahead and run this an hour and a later.

05:01.080 --> 05:01.860
OK, let's see.

05:02.790 --> 05:03.960
Of course, nothing will show.

05:05.810 --> 05:06.620
For a little bit.

05:09.040 --> 05:14.440
While the moment we get to greater the three equal, greater the three right index, then we can see

05:14.440 --> 05:18.370
a little bit is starting to show they're starting to grow.

05:19.030 --> 05:19.390
All right.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.370
As we keep going.

05:21.450 --> 05:21.820
Whoops.

05:26.870 --> 05:27.950
And there we go.

05:28.220 --> 05:31.970
Well, it's working, all right, very good.

05:32.450 --> 05:38.180
The next thing we want to do is this is just for play is that inside of our button because we noticed

05:38.180 --> 05:40.460
that once we have that button, oh, what is it?

05:42.620 --> 05:44.750
Let's go to our composable show progress.

05:44.750 --> 05:49.790
That is, and you will see that now inside of this row scope.

05:49.790 --> 05:56.270
Here we can pass some sort of text as a text, which is going to be our score.

05:56.510 --> 06:04.340
So when I say text such and I say score, I'm going to actually multiply that to make it larger number

06:04.340 --> 06:06.440
score, whatever we're getting.

06:06.440 --> 06:11.210
And when I multiply that by 10, I can say that to a string.

06:11.660 --> 06:22.220
So we are able to show in our text there and then let's say modifier shape inside is going to be a rounded

06:22.970 --> 06:23.900
corner shape.

06:29.040 --> 06:29.730
GDP.

06:37.610 --> 06:38.540
And Max.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.070
Max Height.

06:48.720 --> 06:56.430
When I give it a fraction of about two zero zero zero eighty seven, I have.

06:58.740 --> 07:01.020
Because I found that that's the correct number.

07:01.680 --> 07:01.960
OK.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.930
And.

07:06.850 --> 07:08.290
Max with.

07:10.270 --> 07:12.500
It's fine takes the whole with.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.490
And let's give it a pattern.

07:15.940 --> 07:19.930
About six deep such.

07:22.550 --> 07:31.790
And people of color are going to make the text of white hopes.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.000
Takes a line.

07:40.240 --> 07:45.940
I'm going to say text a line, I want this to be in the middle of the screen.

07:46.210 --> 07:46.510
All right.

07:47.980 --> 07:48.910
Let's see.

07:50.280 --> 07:56.370
Now, this is not going to show anything less refreshed because we will have to we'll have to change

07:56.370 --> 08:00.030
our progress, just get rid of this for now.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.660
So we can see what we just added.

08:06.210 --> 08:13.860
OK, let's refresh once again, I think so you can see now at first is going to be hidden and ultimately

08:13.860 --> 08:16.470
that's fine, just a little play that I'm doing here.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.070
And then at some point these are going to start seeing their score.

08:20.400 --> 08:20.700
OK.

08:20.890 --> 08:24.780
Of course, you can change to whatever you want, but I just thought it would be really cool that you

08:24.780 --> 08:27.120
score one reveal until you're far along.

08:27.780 --> 08:28.200
All right.

08:28.590 --> 08:32.160
So let's put it back the what we had here, so we have to progress.

08:35.370 --> 08:35.670
All right.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.660
Let's go ahead and run.

08:39.930 --> 08:40.940
Let's try again.

08:45.970 --> 08:51.430
OK, it's showing the same thing we had before, and I just know by now we're not going to be able to

08:51.430 --> 08:55.690
see the actual text or the score until it's far along.

08:56.140 --> 09:05.560
But now you know that everything is working and it's great right now as an exercise when users get it,

09:05.860 --> 09:07.630
when users get the answer wrong.

09:08.410 --> 09:15.160
I know that we have here this red read here, hear what it could do is you can actually subtract one

09:15.160 --> 09:20.320
or two from their score that something will be a good exercise for you to do.

09:20.590 --> 09:21.580
You can implement that.

09:22.510 --> 09:22.870
All right.

09:23.020 --> 09:29.440
So we're making really good progress here, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that this inspires you

09:29.440 --> 09:35.680
to go and make another application something similar or make this better because we have the data,

09:36.010 --> 09:38.860
you have the mechanics, everything is there for you.

09:38.890 --> 09:42.280
You can just go ahead and continue making this better.

09:42.310 --> 09:47.710
One of the things that you could do as an exercise and exercise actually challenge is to see how can

09:47.710 --> 09:51.820
you track, for instance, the score and save it right?

09:52.300 --> 09:58.150
And also see if you could save the state of the questions.

09:58.150 --> 10:05.140
Meaning if I get out of this app at this point, try to save the index so that next time they come back,

10:05.440 --> 10:09.700
they can go back to where they left it off in this case in this question.

10:10.410 --> 10:10.600
OK.

10:11.020 --> 10:16.780
Not that that may require a little bit of digging, so go ahead and figure out how can you save small

10:16.780 --> 10:20.210
pieces of data in this case, you just want to save the score.

10:20.530 --> 10:28.060
And if you want to save the index when they leave the app so that next time they come back, they can

10:28.060 --> 10:31.900
see their score and the score comes back, the score, the last score comes back.

10:32.140 --> 10:39.970
But also what will come back is the index, which will be passed onto the list so they can see the question

10:39.970 --> 10:40.900
where they left off.

10:41.170 --> 10:41.480
OK.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.130
Take your time.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.110
You may take a little while, but you can do it.

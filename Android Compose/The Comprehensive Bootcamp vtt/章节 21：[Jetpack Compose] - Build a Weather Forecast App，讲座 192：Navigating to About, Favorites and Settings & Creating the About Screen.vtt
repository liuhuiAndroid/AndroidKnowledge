WEBVTT

00:01.950 --> 00:07.710
So we know that this is working, that's really exciting, so we can get out of there by tapping anywhere

00:07.710 --> 00:10.320
outside the dropdown.

00:10.740 --> 00:18.750
OK, I get it is that when we click on about favorites or settings, we need to be taken to those respective

00:18.750 --> 00:19.230
screens.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.930
So where does that happen?

00:21.960 --> 00:27.420
Well, all of that happens inside of this clickable because that's the clickable of the text.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.100
Click ability of this text here, right?

00:29.850 --> 00:33.450
So for that to work, really, I'm going to have to say nav controller.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.000
All right, there we go.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.430
Beautiful nav controller and say, navigate.

00:40.430 --> 00:45.500
Make sure you get the correct right to string like this and then inside here.

00:45.560 --> 00:53.630
We are going to check to see which one has been tapped and I'm going to use the when statement again

00:53.630 --> 00:54.830
because it's just so helpful.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.510
I'm going to pass the text.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.410
So essentially, it's going to be exactly what we had here.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.170
So let's be.

01:01.580 --> 01:02.630
Just get.

01:03.730 --> 01:13.360
That but instead of doing this, what I want to do is if we are if a powder has been leaked, we're

01:13.360 --> 01:21.400
going to say whether screens and I'm going to about screen that name like this.

01:23.710 --> 01:24.070
OK.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.870
If favorites.

01:26.230 --> 01:35.770
It's going to be the same thing, except we will change the route that we favor its screen.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.680
Now, the case, we know it's going to be our settings screen.

01:40.690 --> 01:41.200
So

01:43.990 --> 01:48.910
now we don't have about screen, we don't have favorite screen, we don't have settings screen.

01:48.910 --> 01:49.660
I don't think so.

01:49.660 --> 01:52.660
Let's go and create the actual screen.

01:52.660 --> 01:55.570
First of all, let's go to our navigation.

01:59.170 --> 02:04.090
Make sure that we have those no, we have searched, we have everything else, but we don't have the

02:04.450 --> 02:08.140
other ones, it's OK to eat first.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.040
They about.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.090
Let's go to our screens we're going to create.

02:28.990 --> 02:36.400
A new package, even though about it's very simple, but I'm going to do again about an.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.860
OK, it's going to be a composable.

02:57.290 --> 03:03.140
OK, pass a knife controller in case this text.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.040
For now

03:08.770 --> 03:09.220
about.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.950
OK, that's good.

03:13.090 --> 03:14.160
And then.

03:28.460 --> 03:29.750
And let's get settings.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.110
Let's go and create another package.

04:08.690 --> 04:11.630
Setting the screen composable.

04:17.970 --> 04:21.180
It's always important to pass enough controller because we never know.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.410
And then text.

04:30.030 --> 04:30.390
That.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.510
Let's import that.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.730
And favorite screens, I believe.

04:41.200 --> 04:45.670
Now you can see how easy things get because we we've set up the infrastructure before.

04:48.140 --> 04:51.470
And now we don't have to suffer per se.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.080
To get things.

04:58.380 --> 04:58.830
Added.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.080
OK, much simpler.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.110
Another package for favorites.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.690
Critic Composable.

05:33.630 --> 05:36.330
Pass our nav controller.

05:49.370 --> 05:50.000
Favourites.

05:50.510 --> 05:50.960
There we go.

05:51.590 --> 06:00.460
And let's go to Maine actually to navigation, important, our favorite screen record.

06:01.940 --> 06:03.830
Now we are back in business.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.440
Let's get rid of these for now.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.380
And I believe if we run.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.520
You know, let's see.

06:13.940 --> 06:14.960
Quick, let's go about.

06:16.120 --> 06:25.840
We go to about very good can just move this back if I click on settings, that settings are good, if

06:25.840 --> 06:27.340
I go to favorites.

06:28.450 --> 06:28.840
Nice.

06:29.590 --> 06:29.950
OK.

06:30.040 --> 06:30.580
It works.

06:31.870 --> 06:34.440
OK, let's start with about because I think that is the simplest one.

06:34.450 --> 06:37.930
So let's go open about screen.

06:39.670 --> 06:45.190
And instead of that, we are going to add a let's see.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.850
This is how about looks and it's very simple.

06:48.850 --> 06:50.470
Nothing really out of this world.

06:50.470 --> 06:53.980
So I'm just going to create, of course, add the app bar, which we already have.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.470
And then some text very simple.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.730
And let's do that.

06:58.750 --> 07:02.260
So first, we are going to put a scaffold.

07:08.350 --> 07:10.870
Such an added top bar.

07:14.770 --> 07:21.580
Of course, then I'm going to put a surface here as a placeholder for now, and we get there, so let's

07:21.580 --> 07:23.470
look at at a bar or top bar.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.550
So I'm going to use the weather bar.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.160
We have our nav controller that we need.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.660
That's why we pass it around.

07:33.550 --> 07:38.200
And before that, let's add a title.

07:45.790 --> 07:52.150
And it's going to be about in the analyst pass and icon.

07:56.370 --> 08:04.860
Which is why I say icons, defaults, arrow back and then is main screen.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.350
Safe Falls is not my screen.

08:11.700 --> 08:17.820
And now controllers there, OK, that's all good.

08:19.650 --> 08:26.970
Then, of course, when the back arrows clicked and when I say NAF controller pop back stack like this?

08:27.840 --> 08:28.830
OK, very good.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.940
And now, you know, a surface here.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.480
Nothing really much less safe feel.

08:36.540 --> 08:41.610
Max, we'll have to pass modifier first.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.480
Phil Max with.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.600
And.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.670
You know, Max Height.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.360
And then we're going to add.

09:07.610 --> 09:10.230
They call them just to organize things.

09:11.280 --> 09:18.690
I would say horizontal alignment center or his is only.

09:23.640 --> 09:28.640
The vertical arrangement also center.

09:30.340 --> 09:31.990
And it was going to have a text.

09:40.740 --> 09:50.820
And for this case, I'm going to actually say string resource like this, and I'm going to say are not.

09:52.670 --> 09:53.250
Strain.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.170
And let's go ahead and import this are.

10:04.620 --> 10:10.000
And let's get half name, but actually, I'm going to use something else.

10:10.020 --> 10:10.560
Let's see.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.330
Say about half, right?

10:17.460 --> 10:22.090
So I'm creating a string in our string resources.

10:22.120 --> 10:27.630
Actually, I haven't created it, but it's always a good idea to add all your strings in our, you know,

10:27.630 --> 10:29.400
values, strings like that.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.000
OK.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.460
So in this case, we don't have anything, but we can create it from here.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.060
If I say option, enter.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.100
Let's try again.

10:41.010 --> 10:46.620
So create strong value resources, very good I can create from here, and this is going to be.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.710
Weather app version zero.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.680
Let's see where to see.

11:02.200 --> 11:02.770
That one.

11:03.070 --> 11:03.830
That's fine.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.540
Say, OK.

11:06.410 --> 11:07.250
They would go.

11:09.550 --> 11:12.370
And while I hear, can you give us a little bit of style?

11:18.760 --> 11:20.740
Biography subtitle.

11:22.930 --> 11:25.330
And font weight.

11:27.050 --> 11:30.130
Say bold like that.

11:31.740 --> 11:32.340
OK.

11:37.110 --> 11:40.560
And next, I'm going create this structure here.

11:45.240 --> 11:55.080
And now you're going to be API used for having created this create a screen resource.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.200
I have that resource there.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.560
Just copy like this.

11:59.580 --> 11:59.910
OK.

12:00.270 --> 12:04.360
So really nothing worth talking about, really.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.340
It's just very simple.

12:06.950 --> 12:07.460
That's right.

12:10.420 --> 12:15.670
And let's see what seems to be a problem in the experimental likely to change.

12:15.910 --> 12:18.400
It looks like now it's complaining.

12:18.880 --> 12:27.850
We need to add the experimental API now compose as well as here.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.860
That's something that you just have to do.

12:30.790 --> 12:35.170
Let's actually add this human activity like that.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.420
OK, so we run.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.860
All right, let's see.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.770
Let's go to a boat and there we go.

12:49.520 --> 12:54.200
Nothing too crazy, but it's working now.

12:54.380 --> 13:01.040
All I can do, I can change instead of bold and say light.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.610
Maybe that's better.

13:08.460 --> 13:08.730
OK.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.370
Hi, works, all right, very good.

13:13.730 --> 13:16.100
And that is our about.

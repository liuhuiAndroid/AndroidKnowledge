00:01.370 --> 00:08.000
Let's work on the card for each one of these books, so we still have a few items we need to show here.

00:09.490 --> 00:10.960
It's going to be very simple, let's go back.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.570
Get rid of our book search repository navigation, let's focus on our search screen.

00:17.440 --> 00:22.360
So notebook row here has come down, so we have author.

00:23.020 --> 00:26.860
And let's see what else we need.

00:28.140 --> 00:32.040
Let's say fonts or font style.

00:40.030 --> 00:41.530
They font style.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.050
I want to make that italic.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.170
That's be good.

00:48.940 --> 00:51.560
And let's just copy and paste a few.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.800
These just test this.

00:55.990 --> 00:58.090
These are just text.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.300
OK, so let's work on this.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.010
Give us some space in between so we don't get lost.

01:09.810 --> 01:10.050
All right.

01:10.050 --> 01:13.000
So Arthur, we have an author that's not good.

01:13.020 --> 01:14.160
Well, let's see.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.610
Copy and paste a few times.

01:20.220 --> 01:23.850
OK, so the next let's use date.

01:23.880 --> 01:29.190
So what are we doing next is just going around and finding the information we want to show.

01:29.270 --> 01:33.000
I'm going to get the published date and maybe publisher at some point.

01:33.090 --> 01:33.650
Maybe not.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.740
Maybe that's not important enough.

01:34.740 --> 01:36.330
So depends on what you want to add.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.160
You can add whatever you want here.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.040
OK, let's start with that first one.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.090
So date published date?

01:45.240 --> 01:46.320
We have access to that.

01:47.130 --> 01:53.040
And by the way, we need to spend some time and let's acknowledge something real quick here.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.630
How easy things are right now.

01:54.960 --> 02:02.070
Notice that we didn't have to do much in terms of combining the JSON and the codling object that we

02:02.130 --> 02:06.420
represent in this case model a book, right?

02:06.810 --> 02:10.140
All of that conversion happened in the back with retrofit.

02:10.470 --> 02:15.840
So now we can just say, book that volume info that published date and get that information just like

02:15.840 --> 02:16.350
that, OK?

02:16.620 --> 02:17.640
That's a really, really good.

02:17.730 --> 02:22.560
So Retrofit is a really nice library for things such as these.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.160
We can do a lot of other things with it, but I hope you seeing the power of using retrofit now.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.210
The setting up, of course, can take a little bit of getting used to, but once you have a set up,

02:33.960 --> 02:34.440
you don't.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.090
OK, OK, so we have date.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.120
And what else are we going to?

02:38.220 --> 02:39.810
I was going to change italic.

02:39.810 --> 02:40.710
That's fine.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.350
Let's change this to caption.

02:43.350 --> 02:44.940
That's totally fine as well.

02:45.210 --> 02:46.140
OK, what's next?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.540
How about category?

02:48.540 --> 02:54.960
I'm just going to say move everything when I say book categories.

02:55.380 --> 02:56.120
That's about it.

02:56.190 --> 02:57.390
I don't want anything else.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.830
Just remove that.

02:59.670 --> 02:59.960
Okay.

02:59.970 --> 03:02.280
Let's go ahead and save and run.

03:03.790 --> 03:06.760
I love how we have author date.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.610
When was this released?

03:10.990 --> 03:12.310
And there you have it.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.700
I think that's how you say Einstein.

03:16.990 --> 03:17.470
Let's go.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.140
There you go.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.940
So you can search for any book that you want.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.500
How to read well or get.

00:00.780 --> 00:01.130
Wow.

00:01.860 --> 00:09.150
We've done a lot of things in this section, so we've actually built from scratch an awesome app, a

00:09.360 --> 00:13.270
weather forecast app with a lot of screens, as you see.

00:13.290 --> 00:16.740
So congratulations for getting to this point.

00:17.070 --> 00:22.470
And I'm very excited that you were here and that you stuck with it and you got this done.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.230
So a lot of moving parts, and I hope you found it helpful and I hope you were inspired to continue

00:28.440 --> 00:32.420
learning more about Compose again.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.230
He learned a lot to learn more about Compose.

00:34.500 --> 00:40.620
Of course, you learn about defending rejection and clean architecture, using a few models, repositories

00:40.620 --> 00:45.690
and different ways of thinking about putting together your apps, which is very helpful.

00:46.050 --> 00:52.050
You'll learn about Broom database, how to save data into a database and retrieve that data right?

00:52.050 --> 00:57.390
And do all the operations, crud operations, create, read, update, delete and so forth.

00:57.990 --> 01:05.160
And of course, we'll learn how to use Retrofit, which allows us to do all those HTTP calls and and

01:05.220 --> 01:11.250
get to Jason and create objects that we can then use in our apps that represent that data.

01:11.790 --> 01:19.290
And I would like to thank you for taking the time to go through this section to go through this part

01:19.290 --> 01:21.230
of building this full fledged application.

01:21.230 --> 01:26.850
And as always, I would like to invite you to continue working on this application or something similar

01:26.850 --> 01:32.000
to this, because now you have the tools that will allow you to actually go and do more work, right?

01:32.250 --> 01:35.070
Build applications that you want to build.

01:35.820 --> 01:36.210
All right.

01:36.540 --> 01:39.810
Thank you so much again, and I'll see you next time.

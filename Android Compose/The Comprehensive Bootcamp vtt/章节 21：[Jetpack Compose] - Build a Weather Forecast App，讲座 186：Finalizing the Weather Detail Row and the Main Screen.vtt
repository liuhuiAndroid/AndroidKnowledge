00:00.240 --> 00:06.720
So next, let's add this here, which is going to be the description of the weather that day.

00:07.350 --> 00:13.460
But he also noticed we have something here, we have this background kind of pill like widget.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.930
And then on top of that, we have the text.

00:16.230 --> 00:19.980
So how do we get that to work right to make it look like this?

00:20.760 --> 00:21.960
Well, it's a symbol.

00:21.960 --> 00:26.430
Again, we're going to use our good friend surface are wonderful.

00:26.790 --> 00:33.780
It's always it's always the best canvas or the best widget really to use because it allows us to do

00:33.780 --> 00:35.100
all sorts of things, as you see here.

00:35.490 --> 00:35.760
All right.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.200
So I'm going to say surface, and let's put a modifier real quick.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.990
Of course, what's new out of padding here?

00:44.130 --> 00:45.820
And let's see.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.940
Well, I just want to zero dpi for now.

00:48.210 --> 00:48.870
OK, that's OK.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.050
We can change that, of course, whenever we need to.

00:53.070 --> 00:56.850
OK, let's put a shape, because that is the central centerpiece.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.480
Just add a circle shape.

00:59.490 --> 01:00.870
I don't need to modify anything.

01:01.530 --> 01:02.580
Kind to give it a color.

01:04.980 --> 01:10.050
And for Carla, I'm going to use a hex again, my favorite like that.

01:10.110 --> 01:10.830
It looks good.

01:13.050 --> 01:19.650
And that's about it, all I need to do now is put a text inside of it and I'm going to use the whether

01:19.680 --> 01:20.340
object.

01:25.350 --> 01:31.830
Go to weather and then get the first that I get and go to get description.

01:32.950 --> 01:33.180
Right.

01:34.110 --> 01:35.610
And pass a modifier.

01:38.430 --> 01:46.560
When he gives a padding by for deep and let's add his style while we here as well.

01:46.650 --> 01:53.160
Good material, theme typography and ad caption like this?

01:54.060 --> 01:54.410
OK.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.020
Let's see.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.280
OK, there we go.

02:00.970 --> 02:06.740
All right, we see we have a Wednesday, we have the icon there, the image.

02:07.090 --> 02:08.920
And we have scattered clouds.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.840
Very good, depending on where we are.

02:11.110 --> 02:16.250
And remember, we can always go back and change the city.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.470
Let's say.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.480
Maputo, hopefully that works.

02:23.650 --> 02:25.120
All right, Maputo, Mozambique.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.100
Look at that 86 degrees.

02:28.450 --> 02:31.000
That's really nice and well looking.

02:31.000 --> 02:31.480
Really good.

02:32.020 --> 02:33.280
Just like what we have here.

02:33.730 --> 02:34.480
All right.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.410
What's next?

02:35.650 --> 02:36.160
Yes.

02:36.190 --> 02:39.280
Next, we're going to add these highs and lows.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.340
OK, let's go ahead and do that.

02:44.100 --> 02:51.050
Now, for our highs and lows here, we could have done just add, you know, two separate techs.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.530
That's sort of fine.

02:53.010 --> 03:01.230
But because we know the power of compose, there is this text that we can pass a an annotated string,

03:01.230 --> 03:08.420
which allows us to create annotated strings, which means pieces of strings that we can change independently,

03:08.610 --> 03:10.710
the color, the sizes and so forth.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.100
Right.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.030
So that's what we're going to do.

03:12.210 --> 03:17.790
And it's really convenient for us because notice here for the high, we have a different color, for

03:17.790 --> 03:18.070
the low.

03:18.090 --> 03:24.960
We also have different colors, so to kill two birds with one stone, and that is a very aggressive

03:24.960 --> 03:25.800
way of putting it.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.030
But it works.

03:27.450 --> 03:31.110
We're just going to use that annotated string because it's just easier.

03:31.470 --> 03:31.800
All right.

03:31.800 --> 03:36.900
So that means after our text there, I'm going to say text.

03:38.940 --> 03:44.190
And you can see the difference here, we have the normal tax and we have the text that says annotated

03:44.190 --> 03:46.500
string, which is exactly what we're going to be using.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.560
So I'm going to use the build annotated string.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.460
There's a lambda there, very convenient.

03:54.330 --> 03:54.960
And they're inside.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.190
I'm going to start annotating it.

03:56.370 --> 04:01.220
So I use the width style passing this style for the first string.

04:01.230 --> 04:07.110
So when I say style, I'm going to expand style, which allows us to do all sorts of things.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.170
First one is going to be the color I'm going to pass.

04:13.120 --> 04:19.050
Would say color, I want blue, and I'm going to tweak it a little bit.

04:19.620 --> 04:26.100
Change the alpha to be 0.75 seven seven f like this?

04:26.100 --> 04:26.400
OK?

04:27.630 --> 04:31.630
And next, let's say font weight.

04:33.660 --> 04:34.950
Say, say my bold.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.200
That's fine.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.110
All right.

04:40.200 --> 04:47.700
This is also a lambda trailing lambda, this is where we actually add the the text well, in this case,

04:47.820 --> 04:49.740
the data that we wanted to.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.820
Annotate, so I'm going to say Append.

04:53.380 --> 04:53.890
Look at that.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.080
Can I paint a char text and so forth?

04:56.350 --> 04:58.270
I can even a paint another annotated string.

04:58.540 --> 04:59.380
How convenient?

04:59.940 --> 05:00.220
Right?

05:00.310 --> 05:02.270
In this case, here I'm going to annotate white.

05:02.290 --> 05:06.390
Well, I need to go and get the max temp right.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.240
How do I do that?

05:07.720 --> 05:11.540
If you look at the object, you see, we have temp de minimax.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.710
I want to go and get Max, so it's under the temp object.

05:15.760 --> 05:21.580
OK, so as you can see, once you have data, you can do whatever you want with the user interface.

05:22.240 --> 05:27.340
So I'm going to use the format decimal because I need that and I'm going to pass the weather.

05:31.860 --> 05:34.650
Go to temp object and get the Max.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.040
And as always, I'm going to append.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.130
I believe it was shift to zero.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.960
No, that's not all.

05:43.170 --> 05:43.650
There we go.

05:44.130 --> 05:44.850
Zero like that.

05:44.850 --> 05:45.660
The degree.

05:46.290 --> 05:46.800
All right.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.360
Very well, and I'm going to do the same thing right after our lambada here.

05:52.380 --> 05:58.120
I'm going to use the with style again has this style.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.960
It's going to be a spann's style.

06:02.370 --> 06:03.780
I say collar.

06:05.770 --> 06:09.400
Well, this case is going to be color

06:12.010 --> 06:13.890
and then forget Lambda.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.150
This is what I'm going to hand the text.

06:16.810 --> 06:22.360
I'm going to format decimals and I'm going to pass a weather temp.

06:23.020 --> 06:24.820
Men like this?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.210
And do the same thing.

06:32.130 --> 06:35.100
Well, option zero, there we go.

06:38.140 --> 06:38.530
All right.

06:38.590 --> 06:39.700
Let's go ahead and take a look.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.940
And there you have it.

06:44.480 --> 06:44.990
All right.

06:45.140 --> 06:49.160
It's looking pretty much exactly like what we have here.

06:50.150 --> 06:50.840
All right.

06:50.990 --> 06:59.210
So as it is right now, we could stop here and call it good because it looks great and we get all the

06:59.210 --> 07:00.170
information we need.

07:00.320 --> 07:05.830
Although everything is mechanical here, meaning that we always have to go and change manually.

07:05.840 --> 07:12.140
The city, which is not convenient, especially if you are shipping this app right?

07:12.590 --> 07:18.470
People don't have the code to come in and change the city, so we need to find ways in which we can

07:18.470 --> 07:20.600
actually allow users to add in the text.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.220
In this case, the city.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.940
But nonetheless, it's working perfectly and it's great.

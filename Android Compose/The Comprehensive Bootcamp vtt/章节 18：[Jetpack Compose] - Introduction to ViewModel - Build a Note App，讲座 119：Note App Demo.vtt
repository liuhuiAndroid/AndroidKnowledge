00:00.450 --> 00:04.440
So in this section, we're going to build a note app from scratch.

00:05.070 --> 00:10.640
Now the main point here is that we are going to see not only how to put together the user interface,

00:10.650 --> 00:12.180
we're going to always learn something new.

00:12.420 --> 00:17.670
But most importantly, we're going to learn how to use different mechanism, different tools that we

00:17.670 --> 00:27.150
have to handle state of our data to separate our state even further away from the composable functions.

00:27.570 --> 00:35.640
So that's the main point of the section here, which is to learn how to further hoist our state from

00:35.640 --> 00:40.890
our compatibles so that we have a single source of truth for our data and state.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.290
So this is the app we're kind of building.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.660
It's very simple, as you see in the beginning, will have some, some dummy data that you see there.

00:48.660 --> 00:54.240
But if I click on each one of these, you can see they are deleted so I can go ahead and add, let's

00:54.240 --> 01:01.470
say hello there and say this is my note.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.730
Then we can go ahead and save as we save.

01:04.850 --> 01:07.100
You can see that was added.

01:07.130 --> 01:07.820
Hello, there.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.100
This is my note came in at as many.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.510
That's gibberish, but that's OK.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.450
So and there, though, it was at it again.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.020
Click or tap any one of these.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.690
We will be able to delete very well.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.280
So let's go ahead and get started.

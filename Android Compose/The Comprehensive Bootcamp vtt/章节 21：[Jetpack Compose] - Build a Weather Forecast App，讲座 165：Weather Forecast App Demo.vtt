WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:04.530
So here's the app we're going to be building, and it's going to be a fun app because we all want to

00:04.530 --> 00:06.030
know what's the weather.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.030
So first of all, you're going to see that the app looks pretty slick.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.030
It's very simplistic, but nice, I think.

00:15.540 --> 00:18.210
And you can see the first time you open the app.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.870
There is the city default city in this case, Spokane, Washington and so forth.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.390
But the beauty here is that we can do a few things.

00:24.390 --> 00:27.240
First of all, I can go ahead and tap there to go and search.

00:27.390 --> 00:33.720
I'm actually using my phone here and I can say, I want to look at Moscow.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.850
What's the weather in Moscow?

00:36.060 --> 00:39.960
And it goes and finds Moscow in this case, Russia.

00:40.230 --> 00:48.030
OK, so right away, you can see it gives us the this week the seven day forecast gives us we have their

00:48.030 --> 00:48.950
four degree.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.680
It's rainy.

00:49.980 --> 00:57.590
And you can see that this is also a metric unit, meaning that this is all in Celsius four degree.

00:57.930 --> 00:58.890
Now we can change that.

00:59.130 --> 01:02.760
First of all, before we change anything, think we can actually add a top left?

01:02.910 --> 01:04.170
There we see that height.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.910
That's your favorite if you tap on that.

01:06.210 --> 01:09.900
You can see that we are going to save it added to favorites.

01:10.240 --> 01:14.460
OK, so that way, if I also click there, I could go to favorites.

01:14.730 --> 01:19.870
It's going to show all of the favorite cities that I wanted to know the weather for.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.590
It's really good and we can also go ahead and delete some of these favorites, for instance, and so

01:25.590 --> 01:28.770
forth, and then go back in Moscow is the last thing, we added.

01:28.770 --> 01:29.970
So it shows that.

01:30.840 --> 01:40.290
And we think also you this is that I can tap there and I can go to about let's go back, say about like

01:40.290 --> 01:43.230
this just gives us this screen about this app.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.390
And it can go back.

01:45.390 --> 01:51.040
I want to go to settings, so here's where I can change the units of measurement.

01:51.060 --> 01:55.770
So there are Celsius and there's Fahrenheit, so metric and imperial.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.500
So I'm going to change that Fahrenheit save.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.640
If I go back in, I can see everything is in Fahrenheit.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.530
OK, good.

02:04.950 --> 02:11.190
So it can continue here and look, for instance, real and heat enter.

02:11.250 --> 02:14.520
This will give them a real g G.R..

02:14.550 --> 02:17.370
I don't even know what that is, but it can go ahead and save that.

02:17.580 --> 02:24.600
And while I go back to my favorites, you can see we have Mario there and of course, I can delete that

02:25.050 --> 02:25.680
and go back.

02:25.860 --> 02:31.620
It will show real, but since we delete it from our favorites, it's going to give me the option to

02:31.620 --> 02:33.570
save into my favorites.

02:34.110 --> 02:38.520
So this is the app we're going to be building and we're going to take small steps each time.

02:38.740 --> 02:43.920
There is a lot that we need to take care of in order to have such an application.

02:44.410 --> 02:47.490
OK, so I hope you're ready for this awesome journey.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.360
I'll see you next.

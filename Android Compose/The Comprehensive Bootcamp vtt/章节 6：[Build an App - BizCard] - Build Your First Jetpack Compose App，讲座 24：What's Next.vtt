00:00.390 --> 00:04.230
So we just finished putting together a little compose application here.

00:04.380 --> 00:09.540
It's very simple in the sense that it showcases a little bit of what Compose can do.

00:09.570 --> 00:15.240
Obviously, again, it's a very simplistic idea of what composing you do, but I'm hoping by going through

00:15.240 --> 00:20.220
this process of building this small application, you were able to see the power of compose and get

00:20.220 --> 00:21.000
excited about it.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.080
That's the whole idea.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.550
So what are we going to be doing next?

00:23.760 --> 00:26.010
Well, it will depend on what you want to do.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.780
So next, what are we going to do?

00:27.810 --> 00:29.800
We're going to go back to this learning hat.

00:29.820 --> 00:30.150
Right?

00:30.300 --> 00:37.020
So if you understand Kotlin, you've done the codling before and you're secure in your Kotlin knowledge,

00:37.260 --> 00:40.530
then obviously you're going to skip this part completely.

00:40.530 --> 00:41.910
And that's totally fine.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.270
And remember that these videos are always going to be here so you can always come back and go to different

00:48.270 --> 00:51.900
sections if you need to brush up on codling fundamentals.

00:52.350 --> 00:56.790
So just to let you know the next sections, we're going to dive into codling fundamentals.

00:56.790 --> 01:02.070
So really basics and run perhaps slowly until we get to some advanced concepts of the common language.

01:02.070 --> 01:08.370
And this is very important because Compose uses huddling heavily, and so understanding cuddling is

01:08.370 --> 01:09.420
going to be very helpful.

01:09.540 --> 01:12.900
If you don't know Kotlin, do not skip this section.

01:12.900 --> 01:18.200
I really believe that because then you're going to have a lot of trouble once we start with building

01:18.210 --> 01:19.860
compose applications, using cuddling.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.320
So if you're a beginner, you don't know cuddling very well.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.830
I recommend you just to go through these sections on cuddling.

01:25.980 --> 01:26.220
OK?

01:26.520 --> 01:33.180
And again, like I said, if you want to dive right through and go to jetpack compose sections, you

01:33.180 --> 01:34.110
are more than welcome.

01:34.110 --> 01:37.680
You can scroll down and find where we reach back to compose.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.340
All right.

01:38.550 --> 01:43.050
So again, let's go ahead and get started with Kotlin fundamentals.

01:43.230 --> 01:43.920
I'll see you next.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.120
OK, now we're going to go right into Kotlin fundamentals.

01:48.120 --> 01:54.300
And if you already said no Kotlin, this is an optional section or these are optional sections, but

01:54.300 --> 01:56.020
it's going to be more than one section.

01:56.370 --> 01:59.490
You can just skip all of that and go to jetpack compose.

01:59.610 --> 01:59.920
OK.

02:00.210 --> 02:00.540
All right.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.040
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:00.180 --> 00:02.850
Let's go back to our tip percentage here, which is our slider.

00:03.330 --> 00:09.480
Let's see, how can we construct this so that we can start seeing the differences as we slide left right

00:10.200 --> 00:12.600
and feed our percentage to show correctly here?

00:13.170 --> 00:19.980
Now, if you go up, we see that our state, at least some of our states here, we have our slider positioned

00:19.980 --> 00:20.430
state.

00:21.970 --> 00:29.290
And we know that these are being we know that this the values in our state here are floats and they

00:29.290 --> 00:30.070
start, I'd say.

00:31.270 --> 00:35.230
But what we want to do is want to change this value when we show it.

00:35.650 --> 00:38.660
Because in this case, this float is has decimal point.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.480
So we want an actual full number, if you will.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.110
So we need to create yet another variable inside of him.

00:47.110 --> 00:57.280
Several let's call this tip percentage percentage of such, and we're going to take the float here and

00:57.280 --> 01:02.860
multiply that by 100 to get a nice value like 32 percent to 10 percent and so forth.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.490
So we're putting inside a parenthesis slider position.

01:06.640 --> 01:13.630
In fact, this has to be below our slider position state here so we can use it right.

01:14.050 --> 01:21.970
It's a slider position, state that value and we're going to multiply that by 100 as such.

01:22.150 --> 01:25.480
And we say to Int to convert that value to it.

01:26.050 --> 01:30.160
So again, this is what we're going to be using to show the percentage there.

01:33.170 --> 01:39.650
So back in our slider, we have our slider, we passing the slider position values here which are needed,

01:39.650 --> 01:44.960
we don't have to convert them as they are right now because those are the values that are needed for

01:44.960 --> 01:45.530
a slider.

01:46.640 --> 01:54.140
But if we go back and look our text here with this line below, I'm going to change this because this

01:54.140 --> 01:55.870
is the percentage, right?

01:55.880 --> 01:59.930
So let's say here tip percentage value.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.880
And I've handed the percent just sign like that.

02:04.660 --> 02:08.890
Now if we run this, we should be able to get the correct values.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.660
Is that true, a sea slide?

02:15.200 --> 02:18.920
And you can see it is indeed working because it's zero zero.

02:19.310 --> 02:22.580
And as I go through 16 and so forth, that's very good.

02:22.610 --> 02:26.780
So this is exactly what we need and all the way to 100.

02:27.530 --> 02:28.790
That's where it all ends.

02:29.570 --> 02:29.900
OK.

02:30.260 --> 02:30.980
That wasn't too bad.

02:32.060 --> 02:32.280
Right.

02:32.300 --> 02:38.420
So it seems like seems like we have the main functionality working at least enough so that we can start

02:38.420 --> 02:39.230
doing calculations.

02:39.230 --> 02:46.190
So the idea is that we enter, let's say, 100 and then we should start sliding left or right in.

02:46.190 --> 02:53.930
The calculations should start happening and we can change split by two, three or four and so forth.

02:53.930 --> 02:59.120
And of course, the tip later will have to change accordingly as we change these values, either from

02:59.120 --> 03:01.790
the slider or from the buttons that we're clicking there.

03:02.510 --> 03:02.750
OK.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.150
So this is what are we going to be doing in the next videos now?

03:06.170 --> 03:11.030
So the infrastructure is there now we need to do the actual calculations.

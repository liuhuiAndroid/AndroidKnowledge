WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:06.450
All right, so moving on, let's go continue moving on, let's go ahead and see if we can continue and

00:06.450 --> 00:08.190
add the tip row here.

00:08.880 --> 00:15.030
So we know that this is going to be a row because we have tip tax and then we have to the right here

00:15.060 --> 00:18.930
on the same like really 33, which is going to be the tip amount.

00:18.930 --> 00:22.560
It's going to be calculated as we slide left in down the slider down.

00:22.650 --> 00:27.060
OK, so this is going to be a rule just like what we had at the top and we'll split, which is this

00:27.060 --> 00:27.300
here?

00:27.810 --> 00:32.490
And also because we're still testing things you notice we have this if statement there, right to see

00:32.490 --> 00:36.990
if the state of our form or in this case or text field is valid.

00:37.330 --> 00:37.580
Right.

00:37.590 --> 00:43.440
So what I can do see here, go back to her right.

00:43.440 --> 00:49.470
So since we're still working on debugging and we're still working on our user interface, this validate

00:49.470 --> 00:55.290
here it's a little bit over the top, which means we can actually get rid of this if statement for now.

00:55.290 --> 00:59.250
So I'm just going to go ahead and forward slashes there.

00:59.580 --> 01:02.730
Feckless start from the bottom so we know exactly where it is.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.300
And so click here the end of this call brace.

01:07.410 --> 01:11.040
And let's see where that ends this l state right there.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.020
So I'm just going to go ahead and do this.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.470
And let's go ahead and also do that.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.590
So let's go and run real quick.

01:28.220 --> 01:33.410
So what this will do, it won't look at the validated state because we just testing things out, so

01:33.410 --> 01:37.850
we want to be able to see right away when we run, see how our user interface is coming.

01:39.030 --> 01:41.980
OK, so now every time we're just going to see everything there.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.380
OK, let's go back to our code.

01:44.430 --> 01:50.410
So what we want to do again, we want to put this structure here, which is this tip and add the number,

01:50.410 --> 01:52.830
OK, I will go for our tip amount.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.950
OK, so let's see this row and right about there.

01:59.490 --> 02:01.260
OK, so right about there.

02:01.260 --> 02:04.200
I'm just going to say tip row.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.250
I say row.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.830
And to add a modifier real quick here.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.830
Put in your line

02:17.590 --> 02:22.890
and I'm going to put a padding in for now, let's see.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.990
So we have our row that's going to start.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.490
First of all, I'm going to put a text out, say text like this.

02:34.970 --> 02:36.230
Pass it a modifier.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.100
And I will not align this tax use alignment.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.900
The alignment first.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.210
We want this to be center vertical vertical, you should say.

03:03.510 --> 03:04.470
OK, that's good.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.570
And then what we want to do because it's in a row, we want to give some sort of space right this space

03:09.570 --> 03:10.110
here.

03:10.950 --> 03:11.340
So.

03:13.030 --> 03:14.590
Right after this tax.

03:18.340 --> 03:19.510
I'm going to add a spacer.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.440
Say Modifier.

03:26.270 --> 03:29.530
Give it a width of about 200 dpi.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.330
Then I'm going to add another text, which is going to be theirs.

03:37.110 --> 03:41.760
Now let's just put three like that.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.890
And we want the same thing to happen and pass this modifier here.

04:01.670 --> 04:02.210
Should be good.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.560
OK, let's see.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.860
Now split.

04:08.450 --> 04:09.320
It's refreshing.

04:10.580 --> 04:14.420
OK, so we can see in there we go.

04:14.450 --> 04:15.470
Let's see.

04:18.120 --> 04:18.990
He looks really nice.

04:19.470 --> 04:25.470
Looks this text there less now what we want to code is make sure it's.

04:27.450 --> 04:30.660
I put text this should be tip.

04:32.900 --> 04:33.170
OK.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.770
All right, there you go.

04:36.820 --> 04:37.370
It looks good.

04:37.390 --> 04:42.370
Now let's go ahead and give some space of some padding around this entire row because at this point

04:42.760 --> 04:43.720
this is not looking good.

04:44.290 --> 04:48.280
And I'm going to give you more space and our emulator can be in the background.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.540
So we have more space than OK.

04:50.230 --> 04:51.520
If we need it, we'll call it.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.280
So instead of all row here, we haven't passed anything as arguments.

04:57.370 --> 04:59.230
Let's change that first one.

04:59.230 --> 05:04.360
We're going to say modify your password, modify here because when I change a few things, something

05:04.360 --> 05:10.450
modifier versus padding and I want.

05:12.920 --> 05:21.380
To say horizontal padding, just a general horizontal padding, analysts give about three deep.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.680
And let's keep an eye out of padding here.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.840
Let's give vertical padding.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.300
Of about 12 dpi.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.990
OK, so refresh.

05:57.630 --> 05:57.920
OK.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.400
Looks much, much better.

05:59.490 --> 06:04.770
You can see just a little differences, but we can keep tweaking everything.

06:04.870 --> 06:06.360
But at this point, that's fine.

06:06.420 --> 06:07.080
This continue.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.740
OK, so we are done with this pro tip.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.840
Let's go ahead and add this.

06:14.230 --> 06:20.890
Another row here, which is going to contain the actual percentage in this case of which is going to

06:20.890 --> 06:27.490
contain the percentage, which is which is going to contain the tip percentage by the user is wanting

06:27.490 --> 06:28.000
to give.

06:31.520 --> 06:39.500
Now looking at the structure here, remember these two, so have the slider and we have the text.

06:39.740 --> 06:40.880
They should go together.

06:41.510 --> 06:42.740
If that's the case, then they need.

06:42.740 --> 06:44.170
We don't need a row here.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.910
We need another column because it's going to be top to bottom.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.380
So let's go ahead and do that.

06:49.100 --> 06:49.850
Back to our code.

06:52.390 --> 06:58.030
Right where we finish that tomorrow, right here, and let's go ahead and say column.

07:02.490 --> 07:09.540
And let's just say vertical alignment or arrangement, that is when I say arrangements are going to

07:09.540 --> 07:13.980
be center everything inside of this to be in the middle.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.400
And give it a horizontal alignment.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.020
And I want this to be center horizontally.

07:24.750 --> 07:25.110
OK?

07:25.530 --> 07:26.700
Setting up everything.

07:27.120 --> 07:31.260
And so inside of our column here, first of all, I'm going to add a text because if you look within

07:31.260 --> 07:36.480
this text here, very simple, the process, I'm hoping you feel this way as well.

07:37.110 --> 07:49.290
And for a text here, it's just going to be again, say so far this at 33 percent, OK, and then here

07:49.290 --> 07:56.370
is where are we going to put a spacer because we also want to give some space between the percentage

07:56.370 --> 07:57.780
and our slider.

07:58.680 --> 08:04.890
So you can see the theme is always the same or you can see we follow the same theme here.

08:04.890 --> 08:08.070
So a width of.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.300
Actually, I need height.

08:14.070 --> 08:22.260
So modifier one, the height in this case, right, of about 14 dpi.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.760
You can play with that.

08:24.030 --> 08:24.630
That's fine.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.970
So here is where we put our slider.

08:27.240 --> 08:27.630
OK.

08:28.590 --> 08:31.140
This structure here to create a slider.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.130
It's very simple.

08:32.130 --> 08:36.750
There's one out of the box that we can do two once a slider.

08:37.710 --> 08:41.140
There we go, make sure we get this first letter here.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.280
You can see its Android acts compose material.

08:44.310 --> 08:45.990
That's exactly what we're looking for him to enter.

08:46.350 --> 08:51.480
And you can see also that the same things happened when we were trying to put together when we were

08:51.480 --> 08:54.660
putting together the filled text field, right?

08:54.900 --> 09:00.330
Because the slider, you know, as you slide left and right, it has to consume certain values.

09:00.570 --> 09:06.420
And we have to also get the own value change because we changing values as we start left and right.

09:06.810 --> 09:10.070
So that is what we need to take a look at.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.370
That is what we need to get.

09:11.730 --> 09:14.820
So in this case here, I'm going to just say slider position.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.760
So it's going to be a state which you haven't created yet.

09:21.000 --> 09:28.830
And then the full on change, one value change that is this is going to be a lambada and we're going

09:28.830 --> 09:32.970
to pass into and a new vowel as such.

09:33.390 --> 09:33.690
All right.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.610
So we're going to do some work here in a second.

09:35.850 --> 09:36.210
Now.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.490
So for a slight opposition state here, what do we need to do?

09:44.520 --> 09:45.460
I'm going to copy this.

09:45.490 --> 09:48.600
I'm going to go at the top of our function here.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.720
And we're going to wait another state, OK?

09:54.620 --> 09:55.640
Some might say foul

09:59.210 --> 10:05.030
I could use by delegates or I could use what we have been doing, we say is equal to remember.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.950
And then I'm going to say mutable state.

10:19.040 --> 10:25.880
And for each value and the type they were going to pass, he was going to be a float with a zero f a

10:25.880 --> 10:30.320
sash to say that this slider here, I think, have one too many.

10:32.140 --> 10:32.680
Move that.

10:35.270 --> 10:35.660
Here we go.

10:36.710 --> 10:43.010
So to say again that our SLATTER position sticks as it was so, so as I was saying, our Slatter position

10:43.010 --> 10:48.950
here will take a state, obviously, and the state's values, multiple state values are going to be

10:49.910 --> 10:53.630
there will be floats as we move left or right.

10:53.990 --> 10:56.690
This state is going to be the value.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.080
Of course, the state value is going to be a float.

11:00.500 --> 11:06.050
We have a problem here because we actually are wrapping this latter position with what it will say.

11:06.050 --> 11:12.440
That means we have to get the value so that our U.S. So once you do that, then you see that we run

11:12.440 --> 11:16.490
out of that issue here on values change.

11:16.490 --> 11:20.840
We have this parameter that's passing and we have instead of a lambda so we can use that.

11:21.380 --> 11:25.940
So for now, I'm going to say log D because when I see those values changing, there's nothing more

11:25.940 --> 11:30.050
satisfying than seeing values changing because that just means things are working.

11:31.250 --> 11:31.460
All right.

11:31.550 --> 11:33.680
Just pass that along there.

11:34.250 --> 11:37.670
And this is going to be slider.

11:37.850 --> 11:40.340
Such can use any tag you want.

11:40.730 --> 11:44.090
Let's go ahead and actually run this and see.

11:46.270 --> 11:51.340
On the emulator or in this case or my actual device, my real device, and see if this is actually going

11:51.340 --> 11:51.730
to work.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.500
It's open lock.

11:56.860 --> 11:57.940
Slider such.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.190
All right.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.270
This is very exciting.

12:02.290 --> 12:09.760
He can see there is a slider there, and if he can start sliding and he can see the values are changing

12:10.000 --> 12:12.250
and they are all float values.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.530
OK, that's very good.

12:14.890 --> 12:19.090
But what we need to do also notice as you try to change nothing, really.

12:19.360 --> 12:26.110
The slider doesn't really slide, although the values are changing, but we don't see that thing happening,

12:26.110 --> 12:27.290
this slider changing.

12:27.310 --> 12:32.290
The reason why is because while we have the value, but we are not doing much with it, what we want

12:32.290 --> 12:37.990
to do really is to set a slider position, value or state.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.250
In this case, that value.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.900
We're going to set that to our new value.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.960
That makes sense because that's what we doing.

12:45.970 --> 12:52.000
We start from zero in the beginning and as we slide, as we change the value, we want to update our

12:52.000 --> 12:54.250
slider state the actual value.

12:55.000 --> 12:55.390
All right.

12:55.510 --> 13:02.920
So that's what we need to do to our fresh for to see the physical change instead of just the internal

13:02.920 --> 13:03.340
change.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.090
Of this new value here.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.660
OK, now we can see why the.

13:10.740 --> 13:14.040
And at the bottom, we can see that the values are changing.

13:15.540 --> 13:15.990
Very good.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.550
So we are making real good progress.

13:17.580 --> 13:21.480
You can see was really easy to put together a slider, but there's some work we need to do here.

13:21.780 --> 13:25.260
For instance, we need to make sure that we don't have floats.

13:25.260 --> 13:30.420
So that means we need to multiply by a certain multiplier number to make it so that the percentages

13:30.420 --> 13:32.070
actually look as percentages.

13:32.430 --> 13:34.440
But that's easy and we're going to do next.

13:34.950 --> 13:37.190
And you can see also the tip it's looking good.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.290
Everything is starting to look pretty much like what we have here.

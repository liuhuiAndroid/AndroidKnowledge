WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:05.530
All right, so so far, we are doing good, so we have our app bar, top bar.

00:05.550 --> 00:10.680
There we have the sign out, we have the title and of course, it's very strange icon, but you can

00:10.680 --> 00:11.710
change to whatever you want.

00:11.730 --> 00:12.150
That's fine.

00:12.640 --> 00:12.870
Right.

00:12.870 --> 00:19.770
So now let's go and look at first of all, we can actually change the color to a different color of

00:19.770 --> 00:20.630
our icon, right?

00:20.640 --> 00:26.700
Because if you have over no icon here, you can see that we can say tint and pass a different color

00:26.700 --> 00:27.570
so we can do that.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.140
It's not going to hurt anything and say tint.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.250
I say color and say that.

00:38.120 --> 00:48.310
Light, but say green and then say Coffin Pass and alpha, such about zero point four f like this.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.130
So that way we can just see that a little nice tent there.

00:53.250 --> 00:58.430
Something similar to this, we can play around with this, that sort of thing that was just an optional

00:58.430 --> 01:00.950
thing that actually come to think about it.

01:01.490 --> 01:06.530
I don't really need to add, we don't really need to add that to color so we can do all sort of things

01:06.620 --> 01:07.760
once you have our icon.

01:08.060 --> 01:11.930
You can even a passive modifier and the world is your oyster.

01:12.020 --> 01:12.320
All right.

01:12.860 --> 01:16.520
Let's go ahead and move on and put together this structure here.

01:16.730 --> 01:17.720
OK, so let's see.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.100
How can we add this?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.620
OK, so right.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.070
Of course.

01:22.070 --> 01:23.660
Still inside here, I'm going to create.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.760
Another composable.

01:30.640 --> 01:36.130
And call this fun reading right now.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.040
Area.

01:37.990 --> 01:42.370
And of course, here we go to pass books, which is going to be a list

01:45.130 --> 01:48.190
of banned books like this.

01:48.520 --> 01:48.880
OK.

01:49.390 --> 01:52.990
And then of course, when you pass or nav controller like that.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.920
Now we don't have this book yet.

01:57.940 --> 02:00.800
So let's go ahead and create this in book class.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.110
It's going to be a data class.

02:02.860 --> 02:07.180
So let's go to our models.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.360
We're going to right click and create.

02:13.310 --> 02:17.450
Class is going to be a class call and book.

02:18.350 --> 02:19.260
OK, there we go.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.740
So for now, I'm going to pass if you.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.820
Properties into our right here would say.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.460
I'm going to save for it.

02:37.600 --> 02:44.170
Now you'll notice, usually when we pass properties or fields into our primary constructor, we say

02:44.170 --> 02:52.030
foul because we're going to be dealing with forest store database in this class or this data class will

02:52.030 --> 02:58.420
be, of course, creating a book types that we going be saving in target of these forest or won't work

02:58.420 --> 03:01.710
properly if you make these variables fouls.

03:02.050 --> 03:08.080
Right, these properties have to be VAR because they need to be changed as we pass them along into Firestorm.

03:08.740 --> 03:10.420
So that's something to keep in mind.

03:10.720 --> 03:14.530
And for now, and we'll change this class quite a bit as we go through.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.440
So for now, I'm going to create a string here, which could be null.

03:17.980 --> 03:23.500
And then I'm going to go create another one for the title of the book.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.990
Make this knowable all over again.

03:29.950 --> 03:40.830
Authors, it's going to be a string cheese because we know and notes, OK, we are coming back.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.580
We'll be coming back to do more work.

03:44.170 --> 03:46.720
And of course, we'll come back to do more work for our book.

03:47.020 --> 03:51.220
But for now, that's that's fine because we just want to have a structure that we can use.

03:52.060 --> 03:57.760
OK, so that is going to be actually this area here.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.810
So we'll get back to that.

04:00.220 --> 04:03.430
So let's focus again to this area here.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.080
Your reading activity?

04:05.590 --> 04:08.620
So first, let's look at this text here.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.750
Your reading activity right now.

04:11.290 --> 04:14.350
So I'm going to create yet another composable here.

04:15.100 --> 04:15.900
Lots of compose.

04:16.460 --> 04:27.640
Let's just give ourselves some space and then say, Fine, we're going to call this title section and

04:27.640 --> 04:28.660
I'm going to pass.

04:30.420 --> 04:31.320
Modifier.

04:38.580 --> 04:43.620
Label, it's going to be just a text or string, they should say.

04:44.640 --> 04:44.880
Right?

04:45.120 --> 04:51.150
The reason why I'm putting in a different modifier again is because we will be using this title section

04:51.870 --> 04:58.290
here and as well here, so might as well just put in a different in its own composable so we can reuse

04:58.290 --> 04:58.770
that code.

04:59.640 --> 05:05.880
OK, so I'm going to create less create a surface such in the pass or modifier.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.750
Let's keep it padding about.

05:19.940 --> 05:21.110
Five deep.

05:23.660 --> 05:31.070
Start top, about one deep and inside here, I'm just going to put it column

05:34.220 --> 05:39.650
and I'm going to say text and pass a label, of course.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.490
And let's style this.

05:43.550 --> 05:44.970
I say font style.

05:45.590 --> 05:47.180
I'm going to say normal.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.000
Well, it's so well.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.640
We should start with font size.

05:54.650 --> 05:55.220
It's fine.

05:55.310 --> 06:00.950
19 ESP and font style.

06:01.220 --> 06:02.990
I want this normal

06:05.720 --> 06:07.370
text line.

06:07.670 --> 06:10.010
I want this to be left.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.920
Oops, it's come back left.

06:17.130 --> 06:20.560
Text a line like this grey area.

06:21.030 --> 06:28.290
Now we've created the composable that responsible for creating this as well as this at a later time.

06:29.310 --> 06:32.550
OK, now let's look at the structure that we have so far.

06:32.550 --> 06:37.080
So we do have a reader app which has been called inside of our home.

06:37.440 --> 06:37.770
Right?

06:38.400 --> 06:43.410
So this homing member is part of our navigation, which means being called our main activity.

06:44.250 --> 06:51.000
So let me close down some of these because we can have some sort of a better visual of what's going

06:51.000 --> 06:54.430
on now for our home content here.

06:54.450 --> 06:57.180
I'm going to yet create another composable here.

06:59.520 --> 06:59.880
Fine.

07:00.030 --> 07:08.300
I'm going to call this home content, which is going to be called here.

07:08.370 --> 07:12.510
So I'm just going to say home content is such.

07:15.460 --> 07:23.230
And as you know, by now, let's go ahead and also pass the navigation map controller, which means

07:23.230 --> 07:25.870
here I'm going, yes, go ahead and pass our nav controller.

07:27.730 --> 07:28.030
OK.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.300
This also would suffice because they have the same name anyway.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.800
So nav controller to again from home, we're going to pass along.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.230
So there we go.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.320
All right.

07:36.340 --> 07:42.400
So now our home content here, this is where we are going to create pretty much all of this structure

07:42.400 --> 07:42.700
here.

07:43.000 --> 07:43.330
Right?

07:43.540 --> 07:48.820
So anything from below our app bar there all the way down.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.880
So if you look at the structure of everything, everything pretty much is laid out top to bottom.

07:54.890 --> 07:57.370
So which means we need a column.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.760
So let's do that was add a column right away.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.700
And this has a modifier here padding.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.490
It's going to say about two deep,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.260
and I'd see

08:14.840 --> 08:16.790
when I add a vertical arrangement.

08:19.170 --> 08:23.790
I say arrangements, space even evenly.

08:25.200 --> 08:33.210
OK, so now inside when add a row first because I'm going to structure this now, so I'm going to the

08:33.210 --> 08:36.040
first row, second row and so forth.

08:36.060 --> 08:36.330
OK.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.680
So from my row here, I'm going to also add a modifier.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.350
Oops and say a line.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.610
Let's just say modifier.

08:52.900 --> 08:59.110
Online such and I'm going to say pass an alignment of of alignment.

09:01.780 --> 09:09.850
I want everything to be at the start, so it starts goes to the left, OK, inside of our row.

09:10.580 --> 09:15.670
And this is the row where I'm going to first add this title section, which were created.

09:15.670 --> 09:19.330
I'm going to say title section and passing the label.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.520
The label's going to say something like this.

09:21.910 --> 09:29.920
You're reading and then I'm going to put a new line scape there.

09:30.970 --> 09:34.900
Another text that says Activity right now.

09:35.890 --> 09:40.720
Let's take a look at at a preview here so we can see how perhaps all of this looks.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.550
We're going to have issues here.

09:42.580 --> 09:49.660
Let's just say it's equal to nav controller passing in local context.

09:54.350 --> 09:55.380
That current like this.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.310
That way, we can hopefully see something in our preview.

09:58.820 --> 09:59.450
Let's just see.

10:00.350 --> 10:00.720
All right.

10:00.740 --> 10:03.740
So as you see here, we make this like that.

10:04.100 --> 10:08.660
You can see now it's working perfectly well, not perfectly, but at least you can see that we have,

10:08.660 --> 10:10.760
of course, the top bar there.

10:11.090 --> 10:16.700
And we have your reading activity at this moment, which is right below here.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.500
It's OK as we add other items.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.790
This is going to be pulled up.

10:20.690 --> 10:21.060
OK.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.430
Where it's it belongs.

10:23.620 --> 10:27.800
All right, so we're making good progress here, this is starting to look, at least we can see the

10:27.800 --> 10:28.970
pieces coming together.

WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:04.750
OK, so let's go ahead and add this other button or icon there.

00:04.770 --> 00:05.430
Sign out.

00:06.540 --> 00:10.380
So that's going to be right after we have a retitle.

00:11.160 --> 00:20.960
So outside I'm going to add a spacer first because I want to give some sort of space between this title

00:20.970 --> 00:22.320
with the icon.

00:23.250 --> 00:31.770
Let's give a modifier in this case whose width of about 115 can play around with this.

00:32.640 --> 00:32.980
All right.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.810
And next here, I'll have to add, of course, this icon.

00:36.810 --> 00:43.680
But I have to think about it because remember, I'm constructing this reader app bar, which is going

00:43.680 --> 00:45.990
to be used in different places, potentially.

00:46.520 --> 00:46.770
Right?

00:46.980 --> 00:51.600
So if there is show profile is true, that means I am on main screen.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.120
If that's not true, then I'm not going to have that profile, which means I have to change a few things,

00:57.680 --> 00:57.990
right?

00:58.020 --> 01:00.420
Some things are not going to be shown there.

01:00.810 --> 01:06.480
This here, it's actually going to be inside of our actions, an icon button.

01:07.170 --> 01:13.320
And when this is clicked, what I wanted to do is I want to make sure that we exit or we lock the user

01:13.320 --> 01:13.650
out.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.830
Was a firebase going to get instance here and say, sign out.

01:21.650 --> 01:22.070
I this.

01:23.980 --> 01:29.290
But I want something else to happen the moment they're signed out, because if we are signed out, we

01:29.290 --> 01:30.370
want to go somewhere.

01:31.120 --> 01:37.120
I can then say, don't run to have this run block here to say, OK, whenever this happens, I want

01:37.120 --> 01:41.980
to run this unit of code here and let's say enough controller because I have control.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.440
I have access to it and would navigate.

01:45.310 --> 01:45.670
Oops.

01:46.090 --> 01:47.980
Let's make sure that we get the correct one.

01:47.980 --> 01:52.150
Navigate to here, let's say, leader screens.

01:52.630 --> 01:56.160
I'm going to go back to our login screen as such.

01:57.310 --> 02:04.000
So inside, of course, of our button, let's go ahead and add this icon there.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.180
Now, there are different ways to do this.

02:07.200 --> 02:16.110
Now I can add an image here and then go to our resource troubles and invoke an icon such as this OK,

02:17.110 --> 02:22.800
which means then I have to go and find an icon like this on line somewhere and then add it to my project,

02:22.800 --> 02:23.550
which is fine.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.710
But there's a different way to do so.

02:25.980 --> 02:34.320
We can actually import or have an icon's dependency, which will allow us to have more icons than when

02:34.320 --> 02:41.790
we say, like these icons, these are icons that come with Android X rank and say default, for instance,

02:42.030 --> 02:46.380
and we want to get something like this log out if we have something.

02:46.380 --> 02:52.710
But in this case, because these icons are limited because icons take a lot of space in your project.

02:53.040 --> 03:01.230
So when the project is created, Android Studio doesn't dump all of the icons possible into our icons,

03:01.650 --> 03:03.150
library and dependency.

03:03.450 --> 03:09.480
So we'll have to actually add that dependency to have all of those icons, at least most of the icons,

03:09.480 --> 03:09.780
anyway.

03:10.530 --> 03:17.760
So let's come out with go to build a cradle, and I'm going to add this dependencies here that he should

03:17.760 --> 03:20.130
have discovered you should have access to it.

03:20.130 --> 03:25.140
So I'm going to just add here now, one of the things to remember is that if you add this dependency

03:25.140 --> 03:33.040
of material icons extended, which has a lot of icons, it will weigh on your project.

03:33.060 --> 03:37.590
So I think there is I think it's about 18 megabytes, which is a lot.

03:38.160 --> 03:45.690
So some people don't recommend you to add all of the material icons to your project because that's a

03:45.690 --> 03:46.540
lot of space.

03:46.580 --> 03:47.130
That's a lot.

03:47.730 --> 03:48.900
But in this case, we're going to use it.

03:48.900 --> 03:54.900
But just keep that in mind that it's a lot of icons that will be added to your project, which will

03:54.900 --> 03:56.400
make your project a little bit heavier.

03:57.470 --> 04:00.900
I get out of here, go back to their home and let's see.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.450
So now I can say something like this icons

04:05.940 --> 04:10.260
and I can say default, or I can even say field, right?

04:10.680 --> 04:17.370
And I want let's see if we can get if I saw the same menu, for instance, look, I can get all these

04:17.370 --> 04:18.240
different material.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.640
Icons, that's very good.

04:22.060 --> 04:27.270
But we don't want that, we want, let's say, log out, maybe log out there, it is very good, so

04:27.270 --> 04:28.150
we have access to that.

04:28.420 --> 04:28.730
All right.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.450
Let's actually add in sort of an icon like this.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.320
And then this icon log out.

04:37.820 --> 04:43.970
And this should be better, and this is going to be logout.

04:44.390 --> 04:47.390
OK, let's go ahead and run this real quick and see.

04:48.260 --> 04:48.490
All right.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.720
Let's go ahead and run this real quick and see.

04:52.070 --> 04:52.820
OK, there we go.

04:52.910 --> 04:53.580
This is nice.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.650
We have that button.

04:55.220 --> 05:01.040
Notice that if I go ahead and click right now, it should go ahead and get I signed out.

05:01.790 --> 05:04.670
And take us to lock in the screen.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.670
OK, let's go ahead and click and voila.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.680
Now we're sign out and we out.

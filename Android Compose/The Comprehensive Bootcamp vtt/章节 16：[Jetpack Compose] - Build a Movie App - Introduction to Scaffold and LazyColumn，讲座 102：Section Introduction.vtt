So in this section, we are going to focus on a few things.

00:04.230 --> 00:09.360
The first thing we're going to look at is Scaffold, which is a UI structure that we can use in our

00:09.360 --> 00:13.650
apps to structure our apps using material design.

00:14.220 --> 00:19.890
And then we're going to look at navigation component, which is a very important set of tools that allows

00:19.890 --> 00:27.090
us to create really amazing navigations and complex in applications in our Android apps.

00:28.020 --> 00:33.360
And we're going to learn how to pass the data between screens using the navigation components.

00:33.810 --> 00:38.820
Also, we're going to learn about lazy column, which is a way for us to show a list of items going

00:38.820 --> 00:40.320
screen efficiently.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.150
And if we're going to do all of these while building a movie app?

00:45.810 --> 00:47.220
OK, so let's go ahead and get started.

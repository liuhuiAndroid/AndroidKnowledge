Shortly after you start the course, Udemy will ask you for a course review.

00:05.250 --> 00:10.650
The rating represents the entire course and not just a lecture, so reviews are very important to me

00:10.650 --> 00:15.360
and other students as well, because that would also give other students the confidence to enroll in

00:15.360 --> 00:18.080
this course and learn as you are doing right now.

00:18.090 --> 00:21.930
So I would love to get a rating and a review from you, of course, but only when you're ready.

00:21.930 --> 00:24.710
So do not read this course until you are ready to do so.

00:24.720 --> 00:29.340
You can dismiss by clicking Ask Me Later, which then it will ask you in a half an hour or so.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.690
So we are going to start with the fundamentals in this course, but feel free to skip the lectures if

00:33.690 --> 00:37.020
you already know the material or if you just want to skim through.

00:37.290 --> 00:38.610
You also are free to do so.

00:39.430 --> 00:40.410
Okay, thank you.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.490
And I'll see you in the next video.

WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:05.470
So now we're going to embark on a different journey here in order to build a full fledged application.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.470
I mean, I'm talking about a loaded app with the back end and all sort of things.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.130
OK, so here are some screenshots of this application.

00:14.310 --> 00:14.670
All right.

00:15.180 --> 00:20.550
So the idea of this app is going to be to allow users to log in and then users are going to be able

00:20.550 --> 00:25.530
to search an API, the Google Books API, for any books they want to read.

00:25.950 --> 00:31.140
They can then add those books to their library, save them to their library, to the back end, and

00:31.140 --> 00:33.420
then they can start reading those books.

00:33.480 --> 00:33.860
Right.

00:33.870 --> 00:39.120
And so they will tag the books are reading and the books that they've just added right in their reading

00:39.120 --> 00:45.690
list and the books that are currently reading add thoughts or notes on the book that they are reading,

00:45.690 --> 00:50.250
as well as reading and marking as read, leading and updating and so forth.

00:50.370 --> 00:56.220
So we are going to be putting together this very extensive using many libraries are going to be using

00:56.790 --> 00:59.910
clean architecture to build this app the right way.

01:00.420 --> 01:00.810
All right.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.920
It's going to be very exciting.

01:02.220 --> 01:05.880
Let's go next and give you a little demo of the full app.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.910
OK, I'm going to start this demo.

01:08.910 --> 01:09.390
Happy.

01:09.390 --> 01:12.240
We'll see when the first runs.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.960
There's that very animation, a very nice animation, a reader and then go straight to the log in screen.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.320
Now we can log in or we can sign up.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.760
Let's go ahead and click a sign up.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.330
James James dot com.

01:31.050 --> 01:36.210
And then here I'm going to say, and then and let's choose a password.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.110
OK.

01:40.030 --> 01:41.320
I guess it's very good.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.600
And voila, the moment we say enter, it's going to go ahead and create James.

01:47.950 --> 01:52.480
You can see we have this icon there and there is James there.

01:52.690 --> 01:53.040
All right.

01:53.050 --> 02:00.040
So this point, nothing much is going on here, but we have the icon for the app will have a title and

02:00.040 --> 02:01.720
we can sign out if we need to.

02:02.230 --> 02:04.120
So what happens first?

02:04.150 --> 02:06.420
Well, we're going to go ahead and add James.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.290
In this case, we'll go ahead and add some books.

02:08.650 --> 02:14.020
And right when we go to the search books screen, we are able to search the books, but also we can

02:14.020 --> 02:16.180
see that we already can use.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.650
I'm using my phone right now.

02:18.040 --> 02:23.500
Go ahead and choose some of the books that have been selected for us, so I can add this one and it

02:23.500 --> 02:27.520
goes to the details book and I can read about it.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.420
What's going on?

02:28.450 --> 02:29.320
Let's go ahead and save it.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.790
OK, so you want me to save it, to go back and see now, you know, a reading list.

02:33.790 --> 02:34.800
We have our book.

02:35.450 --> 02:38.020
OK, I can go back in search now.

02:38.020 --> 02:44.170
I'm going to search for some books about money and enter and voila.

02:44.620 --> 02:48.580
So there are a few books here, and let's click on that one.

02:49.220 --> 02:50.050
When I save.

02:51.060 --> 02:57.120
And I go back and see now I still I'm still adding those books inside of my reading list.

02:57.500 --> 02:57.960
It's very good.

02:58.350 --> 03:05.040
So let's say now I have added a couple of books and I want to add to my reading now, right?

03:05.700 --> 03:08.910
So let's say that James wants to start reading a book.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.760
So clicking one book, and there we go.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.280
Now we go to the update book here.

03:14.280 --> 03:19.980
And in this case, here we can start reading the book by clicking to start reading and now is tackled

03:19.980 --> 03:20.370
there.

03:20.460 --> 03:23.460
And I can just give it an initial reading of that.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.340
And there's no that so far would say update.

03:25.470 --> 03:30.810
And once you do that, then the book is now added to the reading list right now, right?

03:30.840 --> 03:32.010
What we are reading right now.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.060
Right.

03:33.210 --> 03:37.050
And you can see now is was removed from our reading list at the bottom.

03:38.440 --> 03:38.790
All right.

03:39.040 --> 03:45.190
So let's say then after a few moments, we are fast readers, we want to add a few thoughts here.

03:46.210 --> 03:52.180
All you like this and I'm going to change the rating to about four and then I'm going to mark this as

03:52.180 --> 03:53.860
read when I say update.

03:54.430 --> 04:00.400
Once you do that, you can see that the book is now removed from our view reading activity right now,

04:00.670 --> 04:01.640
but we can find it.

04:01.660 --> 04:05.010
If you go to our profile, click there.

04:05.010 --> 04:09.880
Can see now we have we are reading zero books at this point because you remember if you go back, there

04:09.880 --> 04:10.990
is no books that we're reading.

04:11.190 --> 04:14.680
OK, but it shows here that we have read this book.

04:14.690 --> 04:18.130
So we have read one book so far and there is the title.

04:18.970 --> 04:21.130
It's very nice and I can continue.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.500
Of course, this one is going to be reading.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.640
I'm going to give it a rating.

04:24.640 --> 04:30.100
Start reading and update right now was updated successfully.

04:30.100 --> 04:30.880
I go to James.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.880
It's going to see that now I'm reading one book.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.290
I haven't finished that book, right?

04:35.710 --> 04:36.250
So.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.350
And you can see also.

04:38.350 --> 04:39.820
It says there started.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.710
And you can see here.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.380
I started November 2nd, finished November 2nd.

04:44.380 --> 04:48.730
So it gives us the date when we started and when we ended or finished the book.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.120
All right, so I'm still reading one book.

04:51.130 --> 04:51.880
I'm going to go back.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.500
Let's see.

04:53.530 --> 04:59.590
I want to say, yep, this was five star markers read and I can change my thoughts here.

05:01.530 --> 05:02.310
The best.

05:04.280 --> 05:08.540
And finished and done so the book now it's done.

05:08.630 --> 05:13.730
I've read all of the books and noticed that no books found for each one of these categories here, but

05:13.730 --> 05:16.490
I can always go back to see my status now.

05:16.490 --> 05:24.410
I have read two books, which is wonderful, and you can see, of course, that I have zero books reading

05:25.100 --> 05:25.580
right now.

05:26.630 --> 05:26.930
All right.

05:26.990 --> 05:33.020
So this is what we're going to be building, all of this is actually being backed up in Firestorm in

05:33.020 --> 05:39.950
Firebase, which means we have the log in, which means we also have the authentication log in, creating

05:39.950 --> 05:44.270
users, authenticating users, and all of that is being done in the background.

05:44.390 --> 05:47.600
So there's a lot to learn, and I hope you are excited.

05:47.810 --> 05:55.460
In fact, you can go ahead and click here to log out, and I can't either sign up or I can log in again.

05:55.610 --> 05:56.810
I believe was James.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.570
I, James.

06:01.040 --> 06:01.750
Dot com.

06:03.350 --> 06:05.270
And let's add his password.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.490
Log in and voila!

06:08.550 --> 06:10.320
He's going to show James there.

06:10.980 --> 06:11.240
All right.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.820
I'm going to log log out, log in as myself.

06:25.800 --> 06:31.020
And log in while so this is a different account to see.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.350
Let's see how many books has Paul Apollo?

06:34.890 --> 06:35.940
How many books is he read?

06:35.970 --> 06:39.030
Well, he's read a lot of books and is willing to right now.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.200
All right.

06:40.320 --> 06:40.710
Very good.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.900
So this is what we're going to be building.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.700
I'm very excited to share this with you.

06:44.850 --> 06:46.830
And let's get started.

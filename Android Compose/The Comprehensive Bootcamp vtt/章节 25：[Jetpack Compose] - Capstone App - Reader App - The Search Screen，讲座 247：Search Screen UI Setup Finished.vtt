WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:04.920
So we see that we have our input field there, but remember our search form.

00:05.250 --> 00:12.210
We do have courses on search, which we can add as a lambda, so this will capture whatever it's clicked.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.600
Whenever we're done, right click on action there.

00:15.330 --> 00:15.870
Say done.

00:16.170 --> 00:21.660
We're going to get the value inside of our search bar there and do whatever we want.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.310
So this is real convenient because now I can say like this oops.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.550
Let's see my be in the wrong place.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.780
Let's make sure we have search.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.160
Right?

00:31.170 --> 00:31.830
Has to be here.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.240
Hi, there we go.

00:33.270 --> 00:35.040
Now I have access to that, so I'm here.

00:35.040 --> 00:35.970
I can say logged.

00:37.710 --> 00:41.220
And we should be able to see this I.D. there.

00:41.610 --> 00:44.220
It's just going to be there's the string that is being added.

00:45.030 --> 00:45.300
All right.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.060
So let's go ahead and run real quick.

00:49.430 --> 00:53.030
OK, so let's go to a search and I say gibberish.

00:53.570 --> 00:54.230
Hit enter.

00:54.710 --> 00:57.050
And you can see we have that gibberish.

00:57.680 --> 01:04.610
OK, this is good because the idea is to take this information attached to our your and get data in

01:04.610 --> 01:05.330
this case, books.

01:06.170 --> 01:06.470
All right.

01:06.860 --> 01:13.820
We get there, continue and put together these simple structure, which is going to be just a scrollable

01:13.820 --> 01:17.780
area in this case, just a lazy column which will contain books.

01:18.180 --> 01:22.280
Just a card containing the name of a book and the image and so forth.

01:22.610 --> 01:29.060
So it's nothing really hard to do, but we're going to do it because we want to be as thorough as possible.

01:29.840 --> 01:36.050
But if you want a challenge, you could just pause this video, stop this video and go and create something

01:36.050 --> 01:36.470
like this.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.850
It's just lazy column.

01:38.180 --> 01:44.900
Create a row white card and add these pieces of information, text and image.

01:45.380 --> 01:45.960
You can do that.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.440
Go ahead.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.750
Actually, go ahead and do that.

02:02.320 --> 02:09.660
All right, so after our landed, they're still inside of this, our column there.

02:10.490 --> 02:15.680
Here is where I'm going to put a spacer and let's say put a modifier.

02:17.150 --> 02:20.900
I'm going to the height, not height end, but height.

02:21.290 --> 02:21.590
Nice.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.450
Such a low about.

02:26.160 --> 02:33.360
Thirteen deep, because I want to have some spacing between the text field and this structure.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.800
They are lazy column.

02:35.310 --> 02:36.700
Yeah, yeah.

02:36.760 --> 02:43.620
Their book list like this and we have has enough controller like that.

02:43.710 --> 02:46.350
Let's go ahead and create this composable.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.080
So what is this book list going to do?

02:56.760 --> 03:05.760
Well, we are going to create a lazy column as such, and let's just use a lambada because it's much

03:05.760 --> 03:06.240
easier.

03:07.740 --> 03:17.040
And in this case, here we are going to say, let's pass a modifier because we want to make this a little

03:17.040 --> 03:23.050
bit larger modifier and would say, fill max.

03:23.310 --> 03:24.480
Let's say fill max.

03:26.580 --> 03:36.090
Size so that both of them, height and width, are covered, and I'm going to pass content

03:38.430 --> 03:39.100
padding.

03:39.390 --> 03:45.770
I'm going to add to, say, padding values, in this case going to be about six dpi.

03:46.350 --> 03:54.480
If you have over padding values, in this case, it just covers all four edges of this lacy column.

03:54.630 --> 03:58.500
So that's another way of of creating the full padding.

03:59.790 --> 04:04.620
OK, so inside here, it's where I'm going to pass in this case, a list of items that I want to see.

04:04.950 --> 04:10.350
But before I do that, let's just create a quick list of something here.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.020
In fact, I can.

04:13.050 --> 04:17.340
Let's go to our most recent reader at home.

04:17.580 --> 04:21.360
I think I already have a list of books that I can use.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.300
OK, there we go.

04:22.320 --> 04:22.890
This is good.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.320
It's going to be very helpful.

04:27.890 --> 04:31.040
So I'm going to create that just added there so we can use it.

04:34.410 --> 04:34.960
There you go.

04:36.820 --> 04:44.620
And so right here, I can then say items as price list items.

04:46.490 --> 04:48.570
I set those items to.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.020
Our list of books in this case.

04:55.740 --> 04:59.990
Then we have a lambada and it's a book.

05:02.630 --> 05:09.560
And so now we're going to pass a row here, so it's going to be a book row, which will require a book.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.340
And I'm going to pass in half controller as well.

05:14.550 --> 05:14.830
All right.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.550
Let's again create this book row.

05:18.180 --> 05:19.410
You get the gist now.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.200
So for our book row here.

05:22.960 --> 05:23.520
All right.

05:23.660 --> 05:28.950
We are going to just create a card by saying a modifier.

05:31.940 --> 05:36.290
Make this clickable item needs to be clickable, get to God.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.850
And then I'm going to say Phil Max with.

05:43.350 --> 05:49.780
And then I'm going to give you a height of about 100 dpi.

05:51.870 --> 05:56.310
Let's just give the padding of three dpi as such.

05:58.230 --> 05:58.730
All right.

05:58.740 --> 06:01.140
And while I'm here, let's give it.

06:01.410 --> 06:07.320
Of course, the shape we want, it's going to be rectangle

06:10.890 --> 06:17.880
shape like this, and I'm going to give an elevation of about seven dpi.

06:19.860 --> 06:25.740
And inside we going to add a row in this row is just going to be first is going to be an image and then

06:25.740 --> 06:31.590
this column there, so Rome going add a column because that's what we're going to need in a bit.

06:32.520 --> 06:43.080
So for our role for, let's say, modifier say, padding about five deep and vertical alignment?

06:45.360 --> 06:48.160
Yeah, top good.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.690
And so kind of add an image.

06:53.250 --> 06:58.710
So let me create a foul here called image URL.

07:00.150 --> 07:04.240
Let's get that image we had before and pass it in here.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.320
OK, for now, at least.

07:07.350 --> 07:09.330
And then I'm going to pass out an image.

07:12.020 --> 07:18.920
Here I'm going to use a painter and lets you remember.

07:21.890 --> 07:29.570
Painter, image painter, this from Coyle, we want data, actually, which is going to be our image,

07:29.600 --> 07:30.110
you're out.

07:30.320 --> 07:36.470
This all will change later because all these images will come from the actual book object.

07:36.650 --> 07:41.510
OK, so here is going to be going to say look image.

07:43.060 --> 07:46.210
So we've put together this structure here, this image.

07:46.510 --> 07:49.310
Now we need to put this structure right.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.920
That's going to be in our column.

07:51.760 --> 08:02.320
And so I'm going to just add in this text is going to say because they book the title, right?

08:05.130 --> 08:05.940
To screen.

08:10.450 --> 08:20.050
And then I'm going to add overflow ellipses like this, so if there's the title is longer than it can

08:20.050 --> 08:21.640
fit here, it's just going to have ellipses.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.000
And then I'm going to do the same thing for the others.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.390
This one we're going to have actually.

08:35.690 --> 08:37.100
Change a few things here.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.360
Can I say, author?

08:45.770 --> 08:50.030
Book Times authors such.

08:56.570 --> 09:02.990
And I'm going to say clip instead of a flow, if it's too much and.

09:04.550 --> 09:06.950
Let's give it a style of material

09:09.200 --> 09:12.490
theme topography.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.570
Give a caption as such.

09:14.880 --> 09:20.630
OK, we'll come back and change, make it even more beautiful, but that looks good for now.

09:23.880 --> 09:28.440
OK would add another say to do.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.620
Add more fields later.

09:33.940 --> 09:34.300
All right.

09:35.620 --> 09:41.710
So this row book row is being called here, if we run because we're passing this dummy data of list

09:41.710 --> 09:44.120
of books, we should be able to see something.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.070
Let's go ahead and run.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.230
Go there and nice.

09:55.500 --> 10:00.830
So we have a few books and everything is looking good, right?

10:00.840 --> 10:04.770
So for our image, we can actually make it even better.

10:05.460 --> 10:06.930
Let's add a modifier.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.940
And they say with pretty smart fire, let's kill about 80

10:17.820 --> 10:24.120
and then I say max height, take up all the space.

10:24.600 --> 10:30.000
I'm going to give a padding and padding.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.760
It's going to be about four dpi, so we're going to give this nice padding at the end.

10:36.220 --> 10:36.510
OK.

10:42.180 --> 10:44.160
OK, I'm using my phone now.

10:44.550 --> 10:44.970
Click.

10:47.010 --> 10:47.370
Nice.

10:47.700 --> 10:48.750
So it's looking really good.

10:49.830 --> 10:54.820
This is wonderful, we can go ahead and try to search something and very good.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.360
So we have the infrastructure set up.

10:57.600 --> 10:57.930
OK?

10:58.950 --> 11:03.000
What are we going to do next is we're going to take a little break from the user interface for a bit

11:03.000 --> 11:08.480
and get the data to upload into our application here.

11:08.490 --> 11:11.460
So we need to go and look at our API.

11:11.580 --> 11:18.480
Google Books API, which is the one that we're going to be using to fetch or search books that we can

11:18.480 --> 11:21.540
then populate here and add it to our database.

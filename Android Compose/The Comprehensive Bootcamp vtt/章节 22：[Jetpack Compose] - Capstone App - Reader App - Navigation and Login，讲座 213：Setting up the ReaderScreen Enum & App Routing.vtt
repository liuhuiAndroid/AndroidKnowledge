00:00.900 --> 00:06.600
So because we're going to have a lot of different screens, it is important to have a central class

00:06.600 --> 00:12.630
in this case, an enum class that will contain the root of all the screens we're going to have in this

00:13.410 --> 00:13.700
app.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.150
And then let's go ahead and start adding a few imams here.

00:18.420 --> 00:21.710
Let's go ahead and start adding a few properties.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.570
The first one is going to be a splash screen search.

00:26.430 --> 00:26.700
OK.

00:27.270 --> 00:35.070
And then another, it's going to be the log in screen, then create account screen.

00:37.410 --> 00:38.190
Know home.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.540
We will have a search screen.

00:45.860 --> 00:49.640
Detail screen update.

00:52.170 --> 00:52.920
And.

00:56.050 --> 00:58.390
These stats screen as such.

00:58.750 --> 01:02.890
So instead of this in, I'm going to create a companion object, a companion.

01:04.180 --> 01:06.880
And here we're going to add a function.

01:07.180 --> 01:12.700
This function here will be responsible for routing things out seamlessly from fruit.

01:13.390 --> 01:18.220
Such and, of course, is going to expect a fruit type string.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.630
So when I call in like that.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.810
And then this will of course, inherit from our readers reader.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.240
So we have access to our reader screens.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.200
They're very good.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.730
So we're going to just set this directly to one expression.

01:31.540 --> 01:38.440
So we're going to say here, we're going to look at the root garden, although if the substring before

01:38.560 --> 01:45.070
going to put the delimiter here for, it's so it's going to look at the root and then decide what to

01:45.070 --> 01:45.790
point to.

01:46.330 --> 01:49.660
So in our case here we have a splash screen that name.

01:49.660 --> 01:57.250
If we get that name of splash screen, then we're going to point that or set that to our splash screen,

01:57.610 --> 01:59.920
our splash screen here in this section.

01:59.980 --> 02:00.310
OK.

02:00.670 --> 02:04.150
And then when I look at the log in screen, get that name.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.310
That's the case.

02:06.310 --> 02:09.050
Then we're going to point that to a log in screen.

02:09.070 --> 02:20.770
Notice that I'm getting the actual composable log in screen such and for the create account screen that

02:21.490 --> 02:26.950
name so that to create account to screen as such.

02:29.650 --> 02:39.370
And they're going to continue search screen, detailed screen and some app data screen name said that

02:39.370 --> 02:41.080
to update.

02:42.110 --> 02:45.410
Screen such and reader stats.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.240
Readers start screening, I say, OK.

02:53.750 --> 02:58.130
And if it's Snow White or whatever we're getting in our route is.

02:59.150 --> 03:03.710
Then we are going to just say, Well, let's just go to our home screen.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.730
Well, let's see your home screen like this, OK?

03:10.100 --> 03:18.140
Else, in any other case, we are just going to go ahead and throw a legal argument exception to say

03:18.770 --> 03:26.580
that the route to you trying to get to which is going to meet this route strain is not recognized.

03:26.840 --> 03:32.360
All we're doing here is just mapping everything with the route so that when we have our navigation,

03:32.360 --> 03:36.830
we can just go ahead and get the screens that we want one navigate to splash screen.

03:36.860 --> 03:39.320
Of course, we say readers get this black screen.

03:39.590 --> 03:43.220
It will know exactly how to map that to the correct route.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.180
And that means we need to also make this Nullarbor section.

03:48.050 --> 03:48.920
All right, there we have it.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.690
So now we have our readers screen.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.700
So all of these screens that we may have for want to add more screens here.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.040
You can come here and of course, add them as in.

03:58.640 --> 04:04.880
This makes it really easy to then extend our application because your app may grow in such a way that

04:04.880 --> 04:09.800
you will need more screens, and that case will know exactly where to go to add those screens.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.080
All right, so what are we going to do next?

04:12.110 --> 04:14.990
Well, next we are going to put together the navigation.

04:15.050 --> 04:21.110
Now we starting from really the basics, the ground up because we need to get this navigation set up.

04:21.410 --> 04:24.590
That way, we don't have to worry about it ever again.

04:25.700 --> 04:26.060
All right.

04:26.390 --> 04:27.080
How soon, next?

04:27.080 --> 04:27.340
VIDEO.

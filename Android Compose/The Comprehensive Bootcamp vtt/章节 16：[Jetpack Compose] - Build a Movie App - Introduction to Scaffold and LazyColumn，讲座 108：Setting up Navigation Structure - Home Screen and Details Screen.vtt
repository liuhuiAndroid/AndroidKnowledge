WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:08.720
All right, so now we are going to create the actual composable, but the actual screen where this destination

00:08.720 --> 00:09.500
is going to represent.

00:10.460 --> 00:14.870
So like I said, we have everything set up, but not really because the way things are right now, we

00:14.870 --> 00:15.810
have everything in mind.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.930
So we're going to separate concerns here.

00:18.140 --> 00:22.730
What this means is that instead of a screens here, I'm going to create yet another package.

00:23.270 --> 00:23.600
OK?

00:24.140 --> 00:26.690
The first package here is going to be home.

00:27.290 --> 00:30.500
This is another way of creating this and it's out of home.

00:31.050 --> 00:35.760
Want to create another file called this home screen i section?

00:37.420 --> 00:39.550
OK, what do we want to happen here?

00:39.580 --> 00:45.240
I'm going to say at composable and this is going to be function home screen.

00:46.390 --> 00:49.330
Now here's another important thing to remember.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.250
What are we going to do here?

00:51.260 --> 00:57.250
We actually going to pass a knife controller type because it didn't have controller member will allow

00:57.250 --> 01:01.180
us to say NAF controller that navigate and we can go to whatever we want to go.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.590
So we always want to pass enough controller in this home screen.

01:06.560 --> 01:13.580
OK, now that means we go back to our movie navigation, I can see home screen like this, it's going

01:13.580 --> 01:18.050
in Portlaoise, go ahead and import this second one to function like this.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.050
And while we say that this expects enough controller, we're going to pass in the controller.

01:23.060 --> 01:24.500
Where do we get our traffic controller?

01:24.530 --> 01:26.000
Well, we've created it already.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.680
And voila, we're passing it there.

01:28.160 --> 01:28.910
What I'm going to do?

01:28.940 --> 01:32.060
Let's go to home and I'm going to read a few.

01:32.070 --> 01:38.220
I'm going to remove this scaffold content here.

01:39.230 --> 01:44.510
So all of this was cut all of that and go to home.

01:46.410 --> 01:52.260
And pass it all, they're going to have problems, no problems, and let's take this as well.

01:52.290 --> 01:57.360
All of this main content, and we're going to add at the bottom because it's your own function, so

01:57.360 --> 02:00.030
we need to put at the bottom there for our content here.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.890
I'm actually going to do the following.

02:01.980 --> 02:07.020
Let's go ahead and just call our main content.

02:07.710 --> 02:14.940
Also, this past INAF controller like such, which means we have to pass enough controller type like

02:14.940 --> 02:15.240
this.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.260
It will make more sense once we actually use that controller.

02:19.290 --> 02:20.550
Now where is this cold?

02:20.580 --> 02:25.440
Well, remember that this is actually called inside of a movie navigation.

02:27.220 --> 02:32.110
Which is really good because we are going to use movie navigation, because that is what it's going

02:32.110 --> 02:34.480
to govern the entire application, white household navigation.

02:34.660 --> 02:39.280
And it will know exactly what is the first item or what is the first screen that needs to be shown.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.790
So, you know, our main activity now, things have changed.

02:43.660 --> 02:44.230
Correct?

02:44.260 --> 02:45.340
Yes, they have changed.

02:45.610 --> 02:47.710
That means here I'm going to still pass.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.140
The content was what we had before.

02:50.650 --> 02:52.690
And this is just this.

02:52.690 --> 02:58.660
My app is being called here, but inside of my app here, I'm going to pass now.

02:58.660 --> 03:03.100
Movie navigation, because again, movie navigation.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.000
Click like this.

03:04.420 --> 03:10.180
It has all the information it needs to know where to go, which in this case, the first thing that's

03:10.180 --> 03:13.250
going to happen because it is indeed the start of this nation.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.260
We have to have a start.

03:14.260 --> 03:18.070
This nation is going to be the home screen pass the composable.

03:18.310 --> 03:22.840
The actual possible is this, which is what we have extracted and put it here.

03:23.380 --> 03:28.600
It's because at the bottom here, we are still not doing what we need to do, which means we have to

03:28.600 --> 03:29.920
pass our navigation.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.310
Movie navigation, we're not using it, but it's OK to pass it there.

03:35.730 --> 03:37.200
All right, so we should be good.

03:37.770 --> 03:40.590
OK, let's go ahead and do a quick who clear close this down.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.900
Another quick recap here.

03:44.880 --> 03:50.360
So we created a home screen, all we did here, just remove some of the code from our home screen,

03:50.360 --> 03:57.240
the main activity that is because now we know that in our movie navigation, we have this knife controller

03:57.240 --> 04:02.420
which created this movie navigation function composable and we have the nav host.

04:02.430 --> 04:08.940
This is where we're going to host all of our destinations, our composable to our screens, and we have

04:08.940 --> 04:10.140
to start with a destination.

04:10.140 --> 04:11.100
Where do we start?

04:11.730 --> 04:12.060
Right?

04:12.690 --> 04:17.550
Well, we start at home screen and we're passing that controller along.

04:18.740 --> 04:25.760
Because from here home screen, we may need to click a button or click each one of those lists.

04:25.790 --> 04:30.050
It's one of those movies, so we can't be taken somewhere else to a different destination.

04:30.950 --> 04:31.550
Does that make sense?

04:32.060 --> 04:37.160
And so our main activity now all we have to do it our main set content here.

04:37.850 --> 04:40.940
We no longer have to pass directly home.

04:41.920 --> 04:49.630
We pass the movie navigation because it has all the navigation, it knows all of the nodes, all of

04:49.630 --> 04:54.370
the composable that we put inside here, we may put as many as we want because remember, this is just

04:54.370 --> 04:56.830
enough host and we pass it all inside there.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.290
We're building again.

05:00.310 --> 05:06.640
We're building this nav graph in this graph and that right now we only have one item which is this home

05:06.640 --> 05:12.730
screen inside of nav host, which is what we have there and we have enough controller which is out there

05:12.880 --> 05:14.980
and we're passing along very nice.

05:15.430 --> 05:19.270
Now let's go ahead and run and see how this works.

05:21.860 --> 05:27.230
And voila, you can see everything is working as if nothing ever happened, right?

05:27.680 --> 05:34.490
We have our main screen, our home screen, and we still have everything like this.

05:35.660 --> 05:36.350
Very good.

05:36.530 --> 05:37.310
Very good indeed.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.720
So now that we understand that our navigation is working, this is really great.

05:41.720 --> 05:46.880
We want to be able to text next, want to be able to when we click this item, for instance, to go

05:47.240 --> 05:49.630
to a details page, let's see how that will work.

05:49.670 --> 05:53.870
Well, it's very simple now because, as I said, all we have to do now.

05:53.900 --> 05:54.860
Let's get rid of these.

05:55.490 --> 06:02.720
All they have to do is go back to a moving navigation and create another composable inside of our nav

06:02.720 --> 06:08.000
host because this is where we put all of our nodes, all of our composable, all of our screens.

06:08.420 --> 06:13.010
So at the end of this composable, the home composable, this is indeed a home composable.

06:13.010 --> 06:20.180
As you can see, I can go ahead and say another composable like this passenger route, you see movie

06:20.180 --> 06:21.770
screens way easier.

06:22.070 --> 06:24.590
And one of the details at this point to name.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.020
And then I'm going to do what?

06:27.110 --> 06:33.940
Well, I'm going to see details screen and I'm going to do the same thing and have controller passing

06:34.100 --> 06:34.790
the knife control.

06:34.790 --> 06:38.660
And now he's going to want to get the details screen from navigation.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.440
That's how we want.

06:39.450 --> 06:43.280
We want to create another screen here, so I'm going to create another package.

06:45.080 --> 06:52.820
This is going to be details like this, which means now instead of details, I can add another file

06:52.820 --> 06:53.930
just like we did see.

06:53.990 --> 06:56.570
Now it's simple because we just repeat the process.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.230
So this is going to be details screen.

07:00.800 --> 07:10.430
I'm going to make it a composable fun details screen and purpose nav controller.

07:12.500 --> 07:23.540
If you want to and for now, I'm just going to say text just to show you details screen.

07:25.460 --> 07:25.820
All right.

07:26.270 --> 07:27.560
So go back here.

07:29.270 --> 07:30.320
Let's go ahead and report.

07:30.590 --> 07:33.500
We want a detailed screen function, and voila.

07:33.800 --> 07:39.590
So now if we go to our let's go back to our home, looks like I put this in the wrong place.

07:39.590 --> 07:40.520
This has to go.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.940
OK, let's restructure this looks like this home is not working.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.390
Let's create another package there.

07:57.320 --> 08:03.680
I say home, just to differentiate, this should be outside.

08:06.300 --> 08:11.970
So a factor that I think he didn't just restructuring things here, homescreen.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.110
OK, now it's all working, so I don't need this, let's delete that.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.170
Not sure why that didn't work, but that's fine.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.870
OK, so we have details, folder or packaging, we have home, so it's sort of a home screen.

08:28.900 --> 08:29.890
Let's go back to here.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.770
We remember that in our main contact, we are passing the traffic controller.

08:33.790 --> 08:37.900
The reason why we passing never control because we want to be able to click and go somewhere.

08:38.230 --> 08:42.130
So right now, because we have enough control, look how easy this is.

08:42.880 --> 08:49.660
Instead of a movie row, we're passing that movie and we're just saying Log D to see that movie, right?

08:49.930 --> 08:50.560
That's fine.

08:50.710 --> 08:51.760
But now look what you can do.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.390
I can say nav controller, dot, navigate.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.040
I have a lot of methods here.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.930
Navigate what we want.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.880
We want the one that says Root.

09:01.060 --> 09:05.200
It's very important, the root one, because if you get the wrong one, you're going to have some errors.

09:05.410 --> 09:09.250
Let's make sure you get to the root like this and where we want to go.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.720
Well, for Root, I'm going to pass a strength, but I know I can just go and see movies.

09:16.160 --> 09:20.810
See movies, screens, I'm going to get Dot.

09:21.230 --> 09:27.050
I won't go to details my name to get the actual value of our DNA.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.100
And that's it.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.290
Look how easy this is.

09:30.290 --> 09:35.300
All we had to do was pass that knife controller because remember, it didn't have controller controls

09:35.570 --> 09:37.580
tells what to do.

09:38.270 --> 09:40.970
That's why I was a controller controller.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.050
Navigate.

09:42.140 --> 09:42.840
Do something.

09:42.890 --> 09:43.880
What is a landing gear?

09:43.890 --> 09:46.100
Navigate where to this route here?

09:47.390 --> 09:49.280
And how do I know this is the correct one?

09:49.280 --> 09:54.380
Because it's just a string that we added in our main screen or movie screen.

09:54.390 --> 09:59.120
This would say that, you know, so it knows exactly it's here, right?

09:59.540 --> 10:01.640
So it knows exactly where to go the route.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.590
Now, if I run this again.

10:07.090 --> 10:10.630
If I click any of this, I go to detail screen.

10:12.100 --> 10:12.790
Let's go back.

10:15.390 --> 10:16.430
You can see it's working.

10:17.630 --> 10:21.740
We have navigation working guys, just do a quick recap here.

10:22.190 --> 10:26.000
So what we did, we did the same thing as we did before, right?

10:26.060 --> 10:30.980
We created in this case, our detailed screen doesn't have much and we passive it that controller.

10:31.550 --> 10:33.080
We're not using it, but that's fine.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.850
We just passing it because we may.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.000
Who knows, we may also want to use the controller later.

10:38.510 --> 10:39.100
We'll never know.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.370
So we'll just pass that controller.

10:40.730 --> 10:42.170
We have access to it, and that's fine.

10:42.950 --> 10:48.830
But most importantly, when we had to do in our movie navigation here in our nav host, right, it is

10:48.830 --> 10:51.260
where this is, where we create the actual graph.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.350
In fact, you can see it, says this nav graph builder.

10:54.350 --> 10:55.730
So we're building our graph here.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.160
Visually, we're building all those pieces.

10:58.670 --> 11:01.100
All of those nodes of our tree.

11:01.430 --> 11:06.920
In our case here, the first one is our movie screen, and we made sure that the star destination is

11:06.920 --> 11:10.040
going to be it in this case, movie screen home like that.

11:10.610 --> 11:14.840
But still, we have to have that composable to say, where is it that movie screen?

11:15.170 --> 11:19.970
Well, the composable is home screen and we pass that nav controller that we create at the top here

11:20.510 --> 11:22.610
and we instantiated through our nav host.

11:23.060 --> 11:25.160
And we know that we want to go to details.

11:25.190 --> 11:29.860
We have to create that composable or in this case, detailed screen passing that didn't have control

11:29.910 --> 11:31.370
again because we just want to.

11:31.550 --> 11:38.210
And most importantly, now we have that route, OK to say this is where when we click, we can just

11:38.210 --> 11:43.430
invoke nav controller that navigate to this place and then we're done.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.650
And that's exactly what we've done.

11:46.830 --> 11:47.190
Here.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.420
That controller then navigate.

11:52.650 --> 12:00.080
Movie screen details name the navigation component and enough controller and have hosted enough craft,

12:00.300 --> 12:04.980
so keep this diagram in mind as you navigate through OK?

12:05.010 --> 12:10.830
Make sure to understand the navigation component contains enough controller nav hosts enough graph nav

12:10.830 --> 12:11.120
graph.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.980
Just think of a bunch of composable that are connected.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.230
It's a graph nav host.

12:16.500 --> 12:21.090
Well, he's hosting all of those composable, all of those screens, nav controller.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.410
It controls all of this.

12:22.410 --> 12:27.390
It says OK, it says nav controller that navigate to X Composable.

12:27.930 --> 12:32.160
So there are more things that we're going to do, of course, to learn more about navigation, especially

12:32.280 --> 12:35.340
being able to click and go to detail screen.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.960
But instead of just seeing details screen, we want to be able to pass along some information that makes

12:39.960 --> 12:40.290
sense.

12:40.740 --> 12:46.020
Detailed screen We want to see details whenever we tapped here, and that's what are we going to be

12:46.020 --> 12:47.960
looking at in the next few years?

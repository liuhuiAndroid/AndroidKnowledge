00:01.180 --> 00:05.710
All right, let's go ahead and put together the search screen, as you see here, so it's going to be

00:05.710 --> 00:06.490
pretty simple.

00:07.390 --> 00:12.010
Let's add, of course, this top bar there and we're going to have a search.

00:12.950 --> 00:16.400
Text field, and then we're going to have a list of the searched items.

00:16.760 --> 00:17.030
All right.

00:17.630 --> 00:19.420
So let's go back first.

00:19.430 --> 00:27.130
Let's look to see if we have that added.

00:27.140 --> 00:28.640
So have the search screen.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.490
We have read your book search screen as such.

00:32.030 --> 00:35.770
And of course, we always pass our NAF controller site here.

00:35.780 --> 00:40.910
I'm going to go ahead and add first a scaffold because I want to have this structure.

00:41.390 --> 00:42.710
So I say scaffold.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.040
And top bar.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.970
And then let's get rid of this

00:54.390 --> 00:56.580
and then let's say.

01:00.710 --> 01:01.370
That's about it.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.270
What we would want.

01:02.690 --> 01:04.310
OK, there we go.

01:06.560 --> 01:06.870
All right.

01:06.890 --> 01:15.980
So for a top bar here, I'm going to reuse some code that would say, and let's say reader at the bar.

01:16.010 --> 01:19.820
Remember this one here, this one, I'm going to say search.

01:24.670 --> 01:30.030
Books like this controller is going to be enough controller to be passing there, I said.

01:30.180 --> 01:35.760
Now the other thing I want to add is that I want to be able to add this back icon icon.

01:35.770 --> 01:42.670
So let's change a little bit our reader at bar to add a few other parameters here.

01:42.700 --> 01:47.140
So the next I'm going to add is going to be an icon like such.

01:47.140 --> 01:51.410
It's just going to be an image vector that one there.

01:51.430 --> 01:56.260
And I'm going to make this Nullarbor, because some cases we don't want to add that here.

01:56.320 --> 02:03.430
Let me add, I'm going to add a on back arrow clicked.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.250
I was just going to be.

02:09.930 --> 02:15.270
Empty, that returns unit, and we're just going to say it's going to be.

02:18.090 --> 02:22.140
We're not going to have anything like that, right?

02:23.160 --> 02:26.790
So it's going to be optional as well as I contend, you know.

02:27.180 --> 02:27.500
All right.

02:27.510 --> 02:34.920
So this will allow us to then right here to add the icon and of course, the back arrow things on there

02:34.920 --> 02:36.120
say icon.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.890
Let's see what is the order title and then icon?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.030
Yes, this would work.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.280
Icon image there.

02:44.820 --> 02:47.940
You might say icons dot default.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.940
And I want the arrow back.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.630
OK, and we're past the show profile right after that one.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.870
I'm going to pass to show profile in this case is going to be false because this is not for the profile.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.250
So again, I'm just customizing our reader app.

03:05.250 --> 03:05.760
That way.

03:06.210 --> 03:11.070
You can just remove some of the items that we would have in our home screen.

03:11.380 --> 03:11.610
OK.

03:12.300 --> 03:18.810
I can also go ahead and pass the optional lambada here, which will allow us to say something like this

03:18.810 --> 03:27.180
now controller that I want to navigate to a route which is string and say reader screens.

03:29.100 --> 03:32.010
I want to go back to our reader home screen.

03:32.610 --> 03:39.300
Now I'm able to do this because remember, I've added this optional on back arrow clicked.

03:39.540 --> 03:46.530
And then I'm going to add another if statement here that will say it fallings and say if the icon is

03:46.530 --> 03:49.320
not null, right?

03:49.320 --> 03:53.160
That means we need to added if an icon here, I'm going to just add that icon.

03:53.160 --> 04:03.390
So when I say icon image vector, I'm going to pass the icon and that this is going to be arrow back

04:04.050 --> 04:04.590
like this.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.850
And if we want, we can give a tent color.

04:13.150 --> 04:17.440
Red and say can't be passing the alpha.

04:18.430 --> 04:21.100
They will say 0.7 F.

04:21.160 --> 04:21.760
Like this

04:24.730 --> 04:25.840
passive modifier?

04:28.280 --> 04:31.110
And, Mike, this clickable because when do you click that?

04:31.230 --> 04:38.970
And so here is where are we going to pass the on back arrow clicked and I'm going to invoke that function.

04:39.880 --> 04:46.080
OK, so what we're doing here is that if icon is not null, meaning that, yeah, so let's go to reader

04:46.080 --> 04:46.680
search here.

04:46.690 --> 04:53.430
So this icon is not null because we're passing something, then we know that we need this case will

04:53.430 --> 04:56.420
know that we need to pass this icon the arrow back.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.500
So we have this structure here.

04:59.070 --> 04:59.300
All right.

04:59.310 --> 05:06.480
Let's see if we can perhaps make this preview of all a preview.

05:07.650 --> 05:09.420
Let's just create a new.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.600
Or knife controller?

05:18.610 --> 05:22.540
Local context current like this, so we can see something.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.320
All right, very good.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.670
So this is why we are able to see and we still have this item here.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.820
So let's go ahead and remove this as well, because that's not helpful.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.690
So let's go back to our component in our radar app.

05:38.770 --> 05:47.500
So for this icon there, I'm going to put in if statement here check if show profile is true, then

05:48.220 --> 05:49.210
this should happen.

05:51.430 --> 05:58.180
I put together a row here so we can put everything in one place and I'm going to cut all of this and

05:58.180 --> 06:00.760
put inside of that row like that.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.950
OK, this shows else.

06:02.950 --> 06:09.040
We're just going to let's just return a box and refresh.

06:11.930 --> 06:12.720
OK, there we go.

06:12.740 --> 06:20.030
So now you can see all we have now is what we want to see, which is we have the search book's title.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.440
And we have the back button.

06:22.370 --> 06:22.710
Very good.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.490
So that is working.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.200
And let's give it some space around there.

06:31.310 --> 06:37.520
Let's get this and put it on the top there because this is the text.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.260
So essentially, we can give some space between the arrow and the title.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.710
Maybe just about.

06:47.630 --> 06:49.970
40 for 40 like this.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.170
Let's see if that will work.

06:52.940 --> 06:53.930
OK, there we go.

06:54.150 --> 06:54.710
That looks good.

06:54.980 --> 06:58.490
Now this is great because, as you see, we put that somewhere else.

06:58.880 --> 07:03.980
Our readable or reader app and we can pass variables or pass parameters here.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.860
Well, then customize our top bar.

07:06.890 --> 07:13.820
So it's really handy because now we can see with minimal work or able to use the same composable into

07:13.820 --> 07:14.750
two different screens.

07:14.780 --> 07:20.180
We have the home and we have the reader, ebook reader book social screen.

07:20.630 --> 07:26.810
So for both of them, we want the capability of having, of course, this top bar, but also want to

07:27.170 --> 07:28.880
customize it depending on the screen.

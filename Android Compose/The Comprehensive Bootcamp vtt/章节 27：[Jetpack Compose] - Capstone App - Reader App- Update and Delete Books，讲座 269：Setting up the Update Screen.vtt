00:01.280 --> 00:06.860
All right, so let's look at this reading list here and added list image for each one of these books.

00:07.730 --> 00:09.680
So let's go to our book list.

00:10.010 --> 00:17.060
There you have the list of the books is good and what is they don't want to do?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.560
Well, let's look.

00:20.860 --> 00:22.180
It is horizontal.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.530
So can structure go to Liscard?

00:25.530 --> 00:26.960
That's what we want to do here.

00:26.970 --> 00:31.200
So, OK, so here we are passing just this book first.

00:31.350 --> 00:32.040
That's OK.

00:32.220 --> 00:33.540
We need something to show.

00:33.990 --> 00:38.610
They can just delete for now, all of that just say and book like this.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.460
Of course, our preview is going.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.660
It's going to look very strange.

00:42.990 --> 00:43.530
That's OK.

00:44.100 --> 00:44.940
OK, I like that.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.120
OK, so let's find image painter right here.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.650
This is no longer needed.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.120
Thank you very much for your service.

00:58.210 --> 01:01.810
Now we're going to pass the real image, say, book.

01:06.260 --> 01:11.060
And it's a photo you're able to string like this.

01:13.330 --> 01:13.600
OK.

01:16.970 --> 01:22.280
Let's give it a run, think now we should see the correct images.

01:27.230 --> 01:28.220
OK, there we go.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.030
Look at that.

01:29.210 --> 01:30.200
These are correct images.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.010
Look at this.

01:31.010 --> 01:34.250
I can actually remember I can still go and add the book.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.850
Well, this ad is programmatic flatter.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.890
And go back, we should see how we go.

01:43.250 --> 01:43.760
All right.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.380
This is great, so it's looking really good.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.120
So at this point here, all the books that we're seeing were receiving the same kind of books.

01:50.300 --> 01:50.810
It makes sense.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.700
We're just not filtering any further.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.910
But it is that, first of all, we want to be able to click on this book first and go to the edit,

01:59.270 --> 02:01.250
go to the edit or update screen.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.270
What are we going to be able to say?

02:02.270 --> 02:07.420
OK, now I'm reading this book, so this needs to go somewhere else.

02:07.430 --> 02:08.990
In this case, it's going to be up here.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.500
OK, so we need to filter through.

02:11.510 --> 02:16.640
But before that, let's go ahead and navigate to the update screen.

02:16.910 --> 02:23.870
So this case and say enough controller because I have access to traffic controllers c c dot navigate

02:25.310 --> 02:26.150
passing a route.

02:26.630 --> 02:32.090
It's going to be readers, readers, screen screens.

02:32.090 --> 02:36.800
That is an update, screen name and what I want to do.

02:37.310 --> 02:39.170
You'll see I'll have to pass something.

02:39.830 --> 02:47.660
I'm going to pass the edit, which is going to be the string this case, uh, the title of this book.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.340
Now we're not done yet because what are we doing here is that we're passing it as a parameter or argument.

02:52.910 --> 02:57.020
So that means I have to go back to our navigation.

02:57.580 --> 02:58.970
It's the same thing we did before.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.680
So here you have to tell name.

03:00.680 --> 03:05.270
So I'm going to do the same thing because we need to pass something to our composable in this case is

03:05.270 --> 03:07.520
going to be on that search screen.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.380
We don't have the details, do we?

03:09.560 --> 03:10.100
We're going to do it.

03:10.760 --> 03:15.200
So I'm going to say file update name such.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.390
In fact, yeah, they name a search.

03:17.960 --> 03:26.390
Let's say readers or reader screen's going to see update screen that name.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.750
OK, and then I'm going to create a composable, of course.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.840
And in this case, and we're past it as a route, I'm going to just actually use the update name and

03:35.840 --> 03:37.460
such because I'm going to pass something else.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.410
It's going to be the book.

03:41.390 --> 03:47.870
Item, I'd like this and then I'm going to pass arguments.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.020
It's going to be a list of them could see the list of.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.440
And in this case, I'm going to say nav arguments here and is going to be book.

03:59.210 --> 04:01.910
Item I.D., that's exactly what we had before.

04:02.600 --> 04:02.900
OK.

04:04.040 --> 04:08.210
And they're going to use the camera there to construct.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.200
To pass the type.

04:10.770 --> 04:13.710
Well, the type here is going to be a string Typekit was a type.

04:16.700 --> 04:23.660
String type like this, and then of course, we have another lambda here, so have the knife backs stack

04:23.660 --> 04:24.010
entry.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.190
This will allow us to pass.

04:25.190 --> 04:30.530
Other metadata won't say back stack or like this works.

04:31.880 --> 04:38.960
And then here I'm going to be able to say, well, back well, nav in this case, back stack entry,

04:39.590 --> 04:40.420
see arguments.

04:40.430 --> 04:44.830
This will allow us then to pass or receive that data when we go to Where Are We going?

04:44.840 --> 04:46.760
Which is going to be the book haptic screen, OK?

04:47.540 --> 04:50.810
And I'm going to say get string and pass the key.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.140
What is the key book item I.D.?

04:55.760 --> 04:58.760
I say, let past that block there.

04:58.770 --> 04:59.720
I'm going to set things up.

05:00.260 --> 05:04.640
I say and pass the book details or update screen.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.360
I'm going to pass the nav controller.

05:09.750 --> 05:15.660
It's going to be able to control that we have upstairs and then I'm going to pass the book item ID,

05:16.050 --> 05:17.910
which is going to be the book.

05:19.510 --> 05:20.110
Item.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.840
Well, actually, the itinerary passing here to two.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.770
All right, we have an issue here because our book a screen doesn't have any of those parameters, so

05:33.830 --> 05:34.850
go ahead and add those.

05:35.540 --> 05:36.520
That's fine.

05:37.310 --> 05:38.240
Add that one to.

05:41.710 --> 05:48.910
OK, now if we go there, we should see that we have these things set up, the beauty here also is kind

05:48.910 --> 05:55.000
of going to pass if you model, which is going to be the home screen view model such as, say, helped

05:56.020 --> 05:56.620
the model.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.570
We'll use that.

05:58.870 --> 06:05.680
OK, so what I'm going to do, I want to put a scaffold here because I want to structure everything.

06:06.370 --> 06:10.180
You do the same thing we did before when I say top bar past that.

06:10.540 --> 06:13.150
And then we're going to have this over our top bar.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.150
I'm going to use our reader app.

06:16.390 --> 06:24.310
Bar title is going to be update book and control is going to be enough control that we're passing before

06:24.310 --> 06:25.280
any of this.

06:25.300 --> 06:30.460
I'm going to pass a few other parameters here to customize even further when I pass an icon.

06:30.610 --> 06:42.490
It's going to be icons dot default arrow back in this pass show profile to false like this?

06:42.850 --> 06:43.240
All right.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.050
Very good.

06:44.230 --> 06:48.610
That set up that same thing we did with the other screens as well, like search screen.

06:49.360 --> 06:49.720
OK.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.150
So what do we do next here?

06:52.170 --> 06:52.450
Well.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.430
Well, we're going to do the same thing we did earlier, which is we're going to produce a new state

06:57.430 --> 06:59.430
here because we want to get those values right.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.840
When I say Val, book info.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.460
We've seen this before.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.000
We produce state.

07:09.050 --> 07:15.680
Initial, let's make sure that this state is attached to a Typekit, which is going to be a data.

07:16.940 --> 07:28.600
Let's just put that in CYA data or exception type, which is going to be a list of M books and then

07:28.610 --> 07:29.480
we're going to pass.

07:29.930 --> 07:32.450
Let's pretty new line Boolean.

07:34.650 --> 07:43.500
Line exception like this initial value, I'm just going to say directly, that's going to be data or

07:43.500 --> 07:44.130
exception.

07:45.270 --> 07:54.090
Data is going to just be, let's see, empty list, and then I'm going to say true for loading bullion

07:54.660 --> 07:58.590
and know for exception here this is going to say nothing empty there.

07:58.830 --> 08:02.940
OK, so our producer here can be a lambada.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.980
I'm going to do so like that.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.820
So and so I'm going to have value.

08:06.840 --> 08:14.420
I'm going to set that up with World View model that data, that value and done.

08:14.430 --> 08:19.620
So we're going to also extract that value, which is going to be data or exception value.

08:19.950 --> 08:24.540
If you have over an hour book info, it's going to be of this type, which is exactly what we want.

08:26.030 --> 08:30.290
OK, so I'm going to create a surface here

08:33.920 --> 08:35.510
and pass a modifier,

08:38.540 --> 08:39.350
say Phil.

08:39.530 --> 08:45.110
Max size just to hit all of them and then the padding.

08:46.940 --> 08:47.870
Three deep.

08:51.940 --> 08:52.220
OK.

08:53.470 --> 08:57.640
And I'm going to put a column in this column.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.860
Let's put a modifier.

09:03.590 --> 09:08.880
The padding is going to be top three TATP like that.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.110
Now the vertical arrangement arrangement.

09:14.400 --> 09:18.510
Top see say top like that.

09:24.110 --> 09:33.650
OK and horizontal alignment, so alignment, so centered horizontal like this can just import guys fine.

09:34.760 --> 09:41.960
So here is where we are going to just had some to see if we're getting something from our view model

09:42.560 --> 09:51.140
dot data and value that date again to a string like that.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.260
Let's call this.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.710
Info like this.

09:59.160 --> 10:05.760
OK, let's see if we run this, we're going to be able to see something when we click each one of our

10:05.760 --> 10:06.180
books.

10:07.350 --> 10:08.340
OK, let's go a quick.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.250
All right.

10:10.300 --> 10:18.940
Nothing broke, so hopefully if I say info like this, OK, looks like info.

10:19.360 --> 10:19.860
Wonderful.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.710
So as always, first goes empty, empty and then at some point get stuff.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.250
So that's great.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.530
That means then we can actually look.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.570
Let's go ahead and remove this again.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.240
We can look at book.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.500
Enfoque is going to have information about our object here, right?

10:35.830 --> 10:37.070
You can check, right?

10:37.090 --> 10:45.610
So here you can check to see if book info dot loading.

10:47.170 --> 10:52.150
If that's true, or actually probably have to say it's equal to true.

10:54.450 --> 10:59.800
OK, because the state won't say linear progress indicator as such.

11:00.250 --> 11:04.330
And then right after we say book info again and shut it off.

11:04.570 --> 11:06.640
So loading to false.

11:07.210 --> 11:19.470
And then in any other case, if I'm just going to say for now, text field model data add value data.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.290
It's a list.

11:21.670 --> 11:26.050
I'm going to say just get the first book and I want to get the title.

11:27.210 --> 11:28.270
OK, let's go ahead and.

11:40.240 --> 11:40.660
Like that?

11:41.380 --> 11:44.350
Let's go ahead and just see what will happen.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.750
Click y la.

11:49.930 --> 11:53.830
So we're getting the correct information.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.380
I think I don't have this book back set up.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.550
Let's go to update.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.470
Where do we have right?

12:02.680 --> 12:11.290
I need to say here because it is indeed going to say now controller that pop back like this.

12:11.650 --> 12:12.010
All right.

12:13.810 --> 12:14.130
That's right.

12:14.140 --> 12:17.920
Again, at least we know it's working because we're getting the correct books.

12:19.150 --> 12:19.750
This one.

12:20.770 --> 12:21.120
Oops.

12:21.200 --> 12:27.310
Looks like I'm getting a bright right makes sense because I'm just getting a hardcoded the book and

12:27.310 --> 12:28.210
just getting the first book.

12:28.210 --> 12:31.840
So that's why each time you can go back, that's working out.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.290
It's great.

12:32.590 --> 12:35.290
I just get the same book any time, so it's good.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.070
It's real good.

12:36.430 --> 12:42.280
So next, we are going to, of course, structure our update here so that we can actually sourcing the

12:42.280 --> 12:44.350
book and then go from there.

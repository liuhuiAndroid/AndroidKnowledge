WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:04.200
Now, it's time for us to look at constructing our splash screen.

00:04.440 --> 00:05.370
It's going to be very simple.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.930
We're going to add a little animation.

00:07.110 --> 00:07.710
It's going to be fun.

00:08.010 --> 00:14.010
That's what splash screens are supposed to be fun, quick and and to the point, right?

00:14.040 --> 00:14.600
Very simple.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.540
So let's go to our main weather splash screen.

00:18.540 --> 00:18.930
That is.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.160
So this is where we are.

00:20.220 --> 00:24.480
You can see it works fine because we have splash screens showing there, but that's not what we want.

00:24.870 --> 00:27.990
Want something more elaborate because we are awesome developers.

00:28.740 --> 00:32.460
So first thing's first, we're going to use our surface, our good friend surface, because it allows

00:32.460 --> 00:38.580
us to create all sorts of widgets, create all sorts of fields, create the user interface that we need.

00:38.590 --> 00:42.990
It's a canvas, most the most basic canvas, if you will.

00:43.350 --> 00:49.590
So I'm going to pass a modifier here real quick, and I want to add a padding like that, and I want

00:50.010 --> 00:54.750
about 15 deep looks like I have an issue here.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.240
It didn't take my modifier as a modifier like this.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.180
Let's also imports our deep.

01:07.660 --> 01:08.110
Very good.

01:09.640 --> 01:16.090
And I am also going to add something else, I'm going to say size.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.610
Put this in the line.

01:24.070 --> 01:28.860
And also, I'm going to add a size, I wanted to control this size of this.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.980
Canvas or face 335bhp?

01:36.080 --> 01:36.980
And then.

01:41.310 --> 01:49.120
I'm going to also pass a shape that I want this to have, it's going to be a circle shape, very convenient.

01:49.140 --> 01:53.310
Give it color, let's say color white.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.220
And I want to add a border.

01:57.390 --> 02:02.520
His forehead, when he supporters stroke and went past the width of this border is going to be about

02:02.520 --> 02:08.190
two dpi and give it a color of color.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.440
Light Grey.

02:13.490 --> 02:14.090
A such.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.130
All right.

02:16.910 --> 02:17.820
So what are we doing here?

02:17.840 --> 02:20.030
We can try to create this structure here.

02:20.870 --> 02:27.890
OK, so inside of this structure, of course, what I want is I want to create I have this icon and

02:27.890 --> 02:29.720
of course, a text, something like that.

02:30.320 --> 02:36.260
Well, that tells me two things that tells me that I should have a structure, a layout structure widget

02:36.260 --> 02:37.880
that will allow me to do so.

02:38.660 --> 02:39.770
I had two things vertically.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.170
And yes, a column.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.430
Is it the best candidate?

02:43.880 --> 02:44.600
So column.

02:49.830 --> 02:55.950
And it would have passed if you arguments here, pass a modifier, this modifier here, I'm going to

02:55.950 --> 03:02.880
say I want to padding to modifier padding of about one dpi, so not too much.

03:04.390 --> 03:05.080
And then,

03:08.470 --> 03:12.250
let's say horizontal alignment of same alignment.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.470
Compose alignment, I want this to be center.

03:21.950 --> 03:22.710
Let's try again.

03:25.840 --> 03:35.320
Senator, horizontally and our vertical arrangement arrangement centers arrangement

03:37.750 --> 03:38.860
appears to be center as such.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.760
OK, so that means all the contents are going to be in a middle per se.

03:45.430 --> 03:45.850
All right.

03:46.090 --> 03:49.210
And let's go ahead and give it.

03:49.240 --> 03:56.360
Put a text first just to see if we are on the right track and say, Find the Sun like this.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.510
Let's go ahead and run.

03:58.660 --> 04:03.010
So control are or shift 10 four windows.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.030
OK, that looks good.

04:08.360 --> 04:14.990
We have that nice circle with the stroke, right, the border stroke, I should say.

04:15.410 --> 04:16.100
And looking good.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.110
So that's not what we want.

04:18.110 --> 04:20.720
We will also want to make sure that we have this icon here.

04:20.750 --> 04:27.430
Now we could create or use the icons that compose already comes with, but they're very limited.

04:27.470 --> 04:37.010
So I do have the few icons that I have as pages, as images that we can add into a project.

04:37.190 --> 04:40.320
Again, you should have and will have access to all of this.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.160
So what are we going to do in our tribal here?

04:43.190 --> 04:49.640
This is where all of our assets that we want to use in our app, we add in this case, images and so

04:49.640 --> 04:49.940
forth.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.890
I'm going to copy them over.

04:51.890 --> 04:55.160
So we have them again, all these assets you should have access to.

04:55.460 --> 05:01.790
If anything, you can go to the kit repository and get them all of those assets and add to your project.

05:02.690 --> 05:02.950
All right.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.580
So I'm going to copy them over there.

05:04.590 --> 05:05.090
A few.

05:06.160 --> 05:06.950
OK, there we go.

05:06.970 --> 05:10.090
So we have a few of these assets, I'm going to just click on them.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.940
This is humidity, which you're going to use later.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.020
And there's the pressure and so forth.

05:17.030 --> 05:20.770
So I want to probably use this sunny.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.540
I'm going to use this one.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.620
I God, that looks exactly like that, right?

05:26.740 --> 05:29.440
That's why I'm going to be doing and we have all that information.

05:31.140 --> 05:33.690
So how do we create or add an image?

05:34.050 --> 05:41.430
Well, luckily, we do have a widget or a composable we can use if I go ahead and say image as such

05:41.940 --> 05:45.660
can see there's different flavors of image composable functions here.

05:46.200 --> 05:52.140
The one we want is the first one, which allows us to pass a painter object.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.130
OK, so hit enter.

05:54.360 --> 05:59.100
And then here I'm going to pass the actual object or the actual image.

06:00.110 --> 06:00.710
So how do we do that?

06:00.740 --> 06:05.420
Well, first of all, because we know we said we want to pass a painter object near, say, painter

06:05.810 --> 06:06.950
like that in my lap.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.490
And here I'm going to pass a painter, a resource ID.

06:12.170 --> 06:18.170
What that means is we need to go and fetch this ID that we get from trouble to get the image.

06:19.190 --> 06:19.580
Very good.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.520
How do we do that?

06:20.540 --> 06:26.900
Well, to do so, we all we do, we have to invoke the R class resource class.

06:27.110 --> 06:34.160
Now it's important to remember that it's kind of very interesting to get that class because if you wait

06:34.160 --> 06:38.720
for a second, you say, Ah, again, see, now we have all these hours and you've got to be careful

06:38.720 --> 06:46.280
because the order we want is our R, as I call it, which means it's going to be the R that is coming

06:46.280 --> 06:49.040
from our packages.

06:49.190 --> 06:50.840
So I'm going to go and find.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.940
You need to go and find where it says something, calm that Bob and Jack weather forecast.

06:58.970 --> 07:03.650
Now this has to be your own if you changed the package name.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.670
Then you to find it, do not get any of these other offers.

07:07.670 --> 07:14.300
You have to get this one because we want to be able to get resources of our project from our projects.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.350
Does that make sense?

07:15.590 --> 07:21.560
So get the R to import that has your package name of your entire app.

07:22.040 --> 07:22.580
Very important.

07:23.060 --> 07:23.300
OK.

07:23.720 --> 07:30.380
And then right now, then when you say Typekit to access, you can go in and say, Travel a lot and

07:30.380 --> 07:31.610
we're going to go and get this.

07:32.060 --> 07:36.200
See, now we have access to all of the drivers that are inside of our travel folder.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.570
So I wanted the Sun like this.

07:40.110 --> 07:41.040
OK, very convenient.

07:41.140 --> 07:41.550
Very good.

07:42.090 --> 07:49.290
And because we need to pass a content description for visually impaired users, we can see that this

07:49.290 --> 07:51.270
is a sunny icon.

07:52.590 --> 07:52.820
OK?

07:54.660 --> 07:54.990
There we go.

07:55.020 --> 08:00.270
Now I want to do something else to this image because I want to make sure that it's small and is it

08:00.270 --> 08:05.070
fits correctly so what I can do, it can pass a modifier of force after words.

08:06.420 --> 08:13.200
And then I'm going to use the size to say, I want this to be about five foot 95 96 deep.

08:15.450 --> 08:15.780
OK.

08:16.590 --> 08:20.040
And before even that, I'm going to also pass the content scale.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.750
Like this?

08:27.240 --> 08:35.700
And I'm going to say content scale, I want this to fit their different variables I can pass here,

08:36.270 --> 08:36.600
right?

08:36.880 --> 08:42.900
I can say crop field bonds, full height inside and on and so forth, and you can explore all of those

08:42.900 --> 08:45.840
if you want to buffet is perfect because everything is going to fit perfectly.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.860
OK, let's see now how this will look.

08:51.210 --> 08:51.750
That's right.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.080
Uh huh.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.720
Well, looks very nice, almost like what we have here.

09:01.380 --> 09:06.270
That means then it was something else we need to do because see, find this on in this case here we

09:06.270 --> 09:10.110
have this different color and it looks much better this way.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.030
So we need to work on our text.

09:12.360 --> 09:12.930
That's very easy.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.750
All we have to do now, we have to style our text.

09:16.170 --> 09:17.490
So when I say style.

09:20.170 --> 09:30.100
And I'm going to use material theme and use typography when they use H5 like this to be slightly larger.

09:30.580 --> 09:38.020
I'm going to give a color this color in this case, if you want to color light gray, right?

09:38.260 --> 09:40.270
So it's going to be something like that, hopefully.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.050
Let's go ahead and run.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.000
Different ways to run this course.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.120
It's right there.

09:48.890 --> 09:49.240
Aha!

09:49.520 --> 09:52.190
Now it looks better, looks exactly what we have here.

09:53.420 --> 09:59.960
But again, so once we have the structure, the navigation, which was very important, you can see

09:59.960 --> 10:03.620
now we can just focus on beautifying our user interfaces.

10:04.010 --> 10:10.730
That is the beauty of compose in many ways, is because it's easy to put things together now, whatever

10:10.730 --> 10:13.490
you can imagine in terms of the user interface.

10:13.790 --> 10:20.630
You can actually build it once you understand how to lay things out using columns, how to leverage

10:20.630 --> 10:24.350
the libraries that come with this toolkit compose it.

10:24.350 --> 10:30.380
You can do all sorts of things, add images, you can scale those images, you can modify things using

10:30.380 --> 10:32.060
modifier and so forth.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.220
And just like that, we have this structure there.

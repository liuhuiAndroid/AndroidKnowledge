WEBVTT

00:01.670 --> 00:05.300
So still in this row here where we have this here reading.

00:06.870 --> 00:13.480
The speaker, what we want to do is we want to add right next to it, we can add this structure here.

00:13.750 --> 00:14.560
There's two things.

00:14.620 --> 00:21.610
So that's what are going to be adding because we know that this we have this icon and also we have this

00:21.610 --> 00:21.980
text.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.580
So this is a column.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.170
So we are going to add yet another column right here.

00:26.320 --> 00:31.570
I say column when add an icon because icons start.

00:32.850 --> 00:36.850
Field and I want this account.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.460
Circle like that.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.800
And for a description, I'm just going to say.

00:46.010 --> 00:51.980
Profile, OK, let's pass a modifier here.

00:54.410 --> 01:01.610
Make this clickable because we want to when this is clicked, we want to go to the stats screen.

01:02.240 --> 01:09.710
We want to go to the stats screen and I want to make sure that this this side of this is controlled.

01:09.980 --> 01:17.450
So I'm going to say size of about 45 db, so a little bit smaller than usual, and I'm going to give

01:17.450 --> 01:18.980
it tint color.

01:19.550 --> 01:19.840
All right.

01:19.970 --> 01:20.840
It's a color.

01:21.390 --> 01:26.840
So let's just use material theme and pass here.

01:27.050 --> 01:38.060
Colors, you know, a secondary variant section and right below it, I'm going to pass the text, which

01:38.060 --> 01:42.950
is going to have, in this case, a name which we're going to add in a second.

01:42.950 --> 01:47.780
Let's add modifier right away so we can modify all of this.

01:50.450 --> 01:51.320
Give it padding.

01:51.530 --> 01:56.630
About two deep and then let's go ahead and add a style.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.880
His material theme, go to typography, and I want this to be over a line so a little bit smaller.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.470
Let's give a color.

02:11.640 --> 02:20.190
Just give it read and let's give a font size about 15 Aspie.

02:21.660 --> 02:27.420
And this makes sure that the max lines here is just going to be one of the reason being is because we

02:27.420 --> 02:29.790
want to make sure that we don't have too many lines.

02:30.210 --> 02:35.180
If the name is too long, we're going to maybe add ellipses or something like that.

02:35.230 --> 02:36.590
That's what we're going to do next here.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.830
I'm going to say overflow.

02:37.830 --> 02:46.590
If the text overflows, I'm going to say I want to clip it so that that way it always fits the correct

02:46.590 --> 02:48.920
amount of letters, right?

02:48.930 --> 02:56.250
And then you can see here, I want to add this nice divider there or this nice line across just to give

02:56.250 --> 02:57.030
it a little pizzazz.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.780
Well, to do that, it's fairly simple.

02:59.790 --> 03:00.090
Call you.

03:00.090 --> 03:03.120
Do you just call divider like this?

03:03.420 --> 03:07.560
And if you have over, of course, you can pass in a modifier, column thickness and so forth.

03:07.560 --> 03:15.000
But we to get the default colors and thickness as you see, the thickness for default is one dpi.

03:16.140 --> 03:16.450
All right.

03:16.470 --> 03:18.990
Let's see if this actually looks like something.

03:18.990 --> 03:19.620
Let's refresh.

03:23.490 --> 03:28.980
OK, so it's starting to look OK, and let's see, go back here.

03:29.610 --> 03:29.930
Very good.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.500
But what we want really.

03:31.530 --> 03:32.280
We don't want this.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.280
We want to give some sort of space between these two.

03:35.550 --> 03:37.350
So there's different ways to do this.

03:37.620 --> 03:43.730
What I'm going to do is let's add a spacer between the section title.

03:43.770 --> 03:53.730
This and this column where we have that in name so we can come right here and put a spacer and for the

03:53.730 --> 03:55.710
modifier here, I'm going to say modifier.

03:57.020 --> 04:05.550
And same with let's just actually pass a fraction here so we can control it depending on what's depending

04:05.550 --> 04:06.480
on the screen size.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.260
OK, that's very nice.

04:08.310 --> 04:15.810
You can see now they are separated, so if I go ahead and zoom out, I can see this is exactly what

04:15.810 --> 04:16.230
we want.

04:16.290 --> 04:20.670
Of course, it's still at the bottom here, but this will be pulled up once we have all the information

04:20.670 --> 04:21.360
we need at a bottom.

04:22.080 --> 04:22.440
All right.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.860
So very good progress.

04:23.880 --> 04:30.210
Now the thing to remember also, we can see here that it seems like since we hear that this name here

04:30.390 --> 04:33.240
has to come from our user, that it's logged in.

04:33.540 --> 04:37.170
So how do we get the user that is logged in and hopefully get the name?

04:37.740 --> 04:41.100
Well, because we know Firebase is our friend.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.160
What we can do really is up here.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.080
I can say something like this.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.200
I can say file current user

04:52.530 --> 04:53.340
name such.

04:54.120 --> 05:03.990
And I'm going to say the following I'm going to put an if statement to say if Firebase both get instance

05:04.710 --> 05:14.880
that current user the email quite a long statement here is null or empty in this case, if it's not

05:14.880 --> 05:17.970
because we have this exclamation point there.

05:18.450 --> 05:26.640
If that's the case, then I'm going to say, get the Firebase off again, get instance, get the current

05:26.640 --> 05:33.870
user, I'm going to get the email right and then what I want to do with that email, I want to split

05:33.870 --> 05:41.940
it right because I want to split it by the ad side so I can get just the first.

05:43.700 --> 05:44.900
Index of all of it.

05:44.990 --> 05:48.680
Meaning I will get in this case, if the email is as such.

05:49.100 --> 05:57.470
Me at Gmail dot com, I'm going to split by act like this so I can just get me.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.050
Let's go ahead and fix that.

06:00.060 --> 06:00.950
Replace with that.

06:01.310 --> 06:01.790
There we go.

06:02.840 --> 06:08.750
Here, in any other case, what I want to happen and I'm just going to add something that says not available.

06:08.840 --> 06:15.980
So if there's no name or we can't find the actual name of this person just going to add in, not available

06:16.100 --> 06:16.450
there.

06:17.270 --> 06:21.440
All we can do also, we can extract this because it's been used a few times.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.530
Put that in a refactor that, you know, variable.

06:25.690 --> 06:31.390
Introducing a variable where we can use that just like this get much better.

06:32.680 --> 06:37.300
So now we have this current username dependent situation, we're going to have something going to get

06:37.300 --> 06:42.940
something that is what we pass here like that.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.210
Probably have to call a Nullarbor like this.

06:48.510 --> 06:53.670
Let's go ahead and run real quick, so at least we can hopefully see all of this in action.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.060
OK, there we go.

07:04.330 --> 07:05.800
Have a logged in user.

07:06.160 --> 07:12.370
And while I can see J is there because J is the user that is connected or that is locked in.

07:13.450 --> 07:18.950
Now we want something to happen when we click on our J icon there.

07:19.270 --> 07:25.060
What do we want to do is we want to be able to take the user to the stats screen so we can do that.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.080
So the code profile there, how do we do that?

07:28.090 --> 07:29.630
Well, we have the nav controller.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.080
I just don't have control.

07:31.090 --> 07:31.930
That's the beauty.

07:32.230 --> 07:32.800
I love it.

07:33.230 --> 07:36.110
And let's go to our root string there.

07:36.130 --> 07:37.600
It's important, I say readers.

07:38.950 --> 07:42.530
Screens, I'm going to go to stats.

07:43.150 --> 07:50.320
Actually, it's got to navigation, navigation if I can type correctly reader navigation to make sure

07:50.320 --> 07:51.700
we have these stats.

07:52.180 --> 07:52.720
You see what?

07:52.720 --> 07:58.870
I have the stats screen here, which means if you were to try, we would have failed miserably.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.570
So let's see.

08:01.900 --> 08:07.840
We are stats screen and this can be reader stats.

08:10.610 --> 08:11.240
Screen.

08:12.080 --> 08:12.950
Let's go there.

08:12.980 --> 08:20.600
That way, we can just pass our nav controller like this, and I can say again because we we're constructing

08:20.600 --> 08:21.380
everything here.

08:22.160 --> 08:27.260
Let's say it's important that there's going to be

08:32.840 --> 08:34.490
that screen, right?

08:34.670 --> 08:35.810
We'll come back to that later.

08:36.080 --> 08:36.470
Problem.

08:36.470 --> 08:40.310
Let's get rid of that and make sure this is correct.

08:40.610 --> 08:41.420
Yes, it is.

08:41.930 --> 08:46.670
So now back to our reader home screen, this should work.

08:46.670 --> 08:50.420
So we should be able to take the user to our start screen.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.590
Is that true?

08:51.690 --> 08:52.730
Let's go ahead and.

08:55.790 --> 08:58.910
Like changes, I think I will have to restart everything.

08:59.000 --> 08:59.600
Let's see.

09:02.090 --> 09:03.480
Right, I have to rebuild the app.

09:03.500 --> 09:03.920
It's OK.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.840
Let's just click there and rebuild everything.

09:07.200 --> 09:07.480
OK.

09:07.500 --> 09:07.980
Let's see.

09:08.010 --> 09:08.400
Click.

09:08.770 --> 09:08.970
Well.

09:10.070 --> 09:10.580
It works.

09:10.940 --> 09:12.290
All right, let's go ahead and continue.

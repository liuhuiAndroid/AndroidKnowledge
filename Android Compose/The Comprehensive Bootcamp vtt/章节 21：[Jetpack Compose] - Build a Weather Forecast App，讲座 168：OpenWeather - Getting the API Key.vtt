00:01.260 --> 00:06.690
So in order for us to be able to get the information about the weather, we need an API.

00:06.870 --> 00:10.590
We need a service that will send or give us that information.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.820
And so to do that, we're going to use open weather map that.

00:14.820 --> 00:19.350
Org so he can go to home that open weather and map that as such.

00:19.650 --> 00:25.260
So in order to get access to the API where we can retrieve the information about the weather you, you'll

00:25.260 --> 00:26.160
have to create an account.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.040
It's very simple.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.070
Just add your email.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.190
I already have an account.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.530
So in this case, let's go back.

00:31.770 --> 00:35.910
So in this case here, I'm saying out, you will have to sign in, click sign in.

00:35.910 --> 00:40.530
If you don't have an account and add your email and whatever they need to create an account.

00:40.530 --> 00:45.430
In fact, you can go here, create an account, add your email password and so forth.

00:45.480 --> 00:45.790
OK.

00:45.960 --> 00:46.650
It's very easy.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.660
And then you log in.

00:48.970 --> 00:50.610
OK, so I'm going to go ahead and sign in.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.610
And once you sign in.

00:54.480 --> 00:59.700
So once you sign in, you're going to be able to see these dashboards so you have services, all the

00:59.700 --> 01:01.650
services they provide and so forth.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.100
And most importantly, you have this API key.

01:04.110 --> 01:07.590
So you need an API key in order for this to work.

01:07.590 --> 01:13.740
In order for you to be able to make those network calls to get the weather right, forecast and so forth.

01:13.950 --> 01:15.320
So this is your key.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.110
This is my key.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.430
So should not use this one, but you need to create your own in order to use it.

01:20.460 --> 01:26.060
So go ahead and create your own API key at the to just create an account and you should get an API key.

01:26.070 --> 01:31.920
Once you get that API key, you need to save it somewhere safe so that we can use it when it's time.

01:32.890 --> 01:33.250
All right.

01:33.370 --> 01:34.210
Again, remember.

01:34.420 --> 01:40.540
Go to open weather, map, open weather, dot org and create an account and create that API.

01:40.750 --> 01:45.430
Now the other thing you can see here, if you go to pricing, there's a caveat here.

01:45.790 --> 01:50.170
So for pricing, depending on what you want to do.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.890
Obviously, we just want to do some something like 60 calls per minute.

01:54.310 --> 01:55.690
We wanted this column here.

01:55.690 --> 02:01.540
So we're going to focus on getting the API, in fact, to get the API for me here, as you see here,

02:01.540 --> 02:04.330
you go to the pricing and say, get API.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.760
You want the free API because you don't want to pay.

02:06.770 --> 02:07.360
We're just testing.

02:07.370 --> 02:14.440
I would recommend to do the free get API free here and you can see the stipulation says 60 calls per

02:14.440 --> 02:16.650
minute I million calls a month.

02:16.660 --> 02:17.680
It's going to be free now.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.760
If you end up having more than that, then you're going to have to pay.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.440
So the free tier is totally fine and that's where you should go for it.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.500
OK, so come here, get API key.

02:29.860 --> 02:35.170
You will have to sign up or signing depending on your status, and then you should get your API key.

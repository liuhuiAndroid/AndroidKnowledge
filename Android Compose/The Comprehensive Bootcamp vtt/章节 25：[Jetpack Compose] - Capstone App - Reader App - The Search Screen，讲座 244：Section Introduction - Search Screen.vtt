00:00.520 --> 00:04.980
Right, so in previous section, we were able to put together the home screen.

00:05.070 --> 00:08.250
We went through the whole process of structuring everything.

00:08.430 --> 00:13.680
Now we are going to make it so that when the floating action button is clicked, we are going to open

00:13.680 --> 00:15.150
the search box screen.

00:15.510 --> 00:22.350
This screen here contains a few items, not as many as we had before in our home screen and to top,

00:22.350 --> 00:27.970
we're going to have, of course, the top bar there to allow us to go back to the previous screen.

00:28.410 --> 00:35.100
We're going to have, of course, this area here where we are going to have a list of books that are

00:35.100 --> 00:36.210
preloaded, right?

00:36.210 --> 00:43.020
These books are going to come from the API, the Google Book API, and then we're going to have, of

00:43.020 --> 00:49.230
course, that search text field there, which will allow users to type something and search.

00:49.470 --> 00:55.650
And then once they hit Enter White or next, then they will repopulate the books.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.480
So this is what we're going to be doing.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.840
And well, let's get started.

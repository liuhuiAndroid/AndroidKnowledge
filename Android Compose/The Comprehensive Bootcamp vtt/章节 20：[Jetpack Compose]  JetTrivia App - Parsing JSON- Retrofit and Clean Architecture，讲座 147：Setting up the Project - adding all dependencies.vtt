00:00.870 --> 00:08.910
So I created a new project, Jack Trivia, and nothing is new here as you see an activity composed by

00:08.910 --> 00:15.780
hello and all the same thing, all the boilerplate code that we get when we create a new compose project.

00:16.110 --> 00:21.300
So I would like you to go and create a new project and name whatever you want, but I would prefer your

00:21.600 --> 00:24.060
name to trivia or something similar to that.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.680
I've set up the project already.

00:26.700 --> 00:33.450
That way, you don't have to really deal with dependencies, at least the basic dependencies.

00:33.840 --> 00:39.750
So if you tap the build.gradle, the app Gradle notice, I've added a few things here you can see at

00:39.750 --> 00:42.030
the top of the dagger hilt, right?

00:42.030 --> 00:46.230
Because we're going to be using dependency injection in this section.

00:46.530 --> 00:50.820
And of course, I have the codling capped as well added there in our plugins.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.870
And if you scroll down, will see a few things that have added already.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.950
So I have this Cortines, all of these dependencies that are needed, right?

00:59.430 --> 01:05.120
I have this whole routine lifecycle scopes that are added as well, and I have the dagger hilt.

01:05.910 --> 01:11.040
This one is top and a few other implementations for capped to cats there and so forth.

01:11.250 --> 01:18.210
So this is what we need so that we are at least set up for a dagger hilt dependency and so forth, as

01:18.210 --> 01:21.090
well as co-writing scopes and Cortines in general.

01:21.630 --> 01:26.370
OK, now I understand there is a lot of things here, but one of the things that I've put together,

01:26.370 --> 01:32.730
in fact, for all of the projects we are going to build or build, depending whether you've been following

01:32.730 --> 01:38.070
us along all of the projects, you can find them in my on my GitHub accounts.

01:38.250 --> 01:41.160
Peter shown in this case, I go to jet trivia.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.300
You can go to our app, right to go to this jet trivia app.

01:45.300 --> 01:49.920
You can see who have built their Gradle, and you should see exactly what I just showed you.

01:49.950 --> 01:54.420
So this is the plugins that we have there and all the dependencies.

01:54.420 --> 01:59.550
So I would really encourage you to come here and and copy all of this as it is at this point, so that

01:59.550 --> 02:02.580
you don't have to type yourself all of these dependencies.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.940
I encourage you to do that and make sure everything is correct.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.800
And of course, depending on when you're watching this video, these version may be higher.

02:11.130 --> 02:11.790
That's fine.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.190
And just go ahead and update them.

02:14.460 --> 02:14.730
OK.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.440
Hopefully, that doesn't break your code.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.720
If does, then we can address that.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.400
But that is what I wanted to show you.

02:21.750 --> 02:31.170
If I go to the actual below Gradle for the project, you'll see that I had this helt version 239.

02:31.530 --> 02:36.240
So at the time of this recording, that is the version again, maybe higher so you change accordingly.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.780
And the compose version is one that oh, that four OK.

02:39.870 --> 02:44.160
And also made sure to add remember, this is a different building Gradle.

02:44.550 --> 02:45.780
This is not the app.

02:45.780 --> 02:46.830
This is the module.

02:47.130 --> 02:47.760
We added.

02:48.060 --> 02:52.950
I should have changed this to one five four two one or higher, depending on when you're watching this.

02:53.280 --> 02:58.170
And you may most likely also have to change the version of the tools.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.340
Build Gradle there.

02:59.940 --> 03:00.240
OK.

03:00.540 --> 03:05.760
And make sure, most importantly, you have to pass this class path for dagger hilt to work as well.

03:06.090 --> 03:06.630
Very important.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.220
All of that can be found.

03:08.490 --> 03:14.730
Of course, if you go back to our app, in this case, I want to go back just to trivia because I need

03:14.730 --> 03:16.410
to get to the Gradle.

03:16.440 --> 03:21.260
Let's see this build a Gradle and you can see exactly what I'm talking about.

03:21.270 --> 03:29.790
So for added these compose and health version, as well as the class path here for dagger built a section.

03:31.430 --> 03:34.910
Make sure you do that, so you have a good starting point.

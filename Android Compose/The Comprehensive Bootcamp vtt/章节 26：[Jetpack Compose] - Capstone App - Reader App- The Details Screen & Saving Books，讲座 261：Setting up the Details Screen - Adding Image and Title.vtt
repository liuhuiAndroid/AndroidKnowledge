00:00.900 --> 00:08.700
So we can even make this even better by putting a column here or rather a row like that.

00:09.120 --> 00:20.310
And I'm going to take this into that, OK, and I have that linear and then here I'm going to say text.

00:20.910 --> 00:27.990
I would say loading like that just to play around with what's going on here.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.480
Let's save this and give it a run.

00:32.310 --> 00:33.220
Very good, quick.

00:33.790 --> 00:36.220
So he's loading, he saw that briefly.

00:38.410 --> 00:39.130
OK, very good.

00:40.480 --> 00:48.730
So we can do the same thing actually inside of our search, I believe, right here.

00:53.370 --> 00:54.830
A horizontal arrangement.

00:58.380 --> 00:59.560
Space in between.

01:03.910 --> 01:04.970
OK, that's fine.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.370
Just playing around with a few things.

01:07.420 --> 01:08.260
Two concepts here.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.730
Let's run, Nancy.

01:15.630 --> 01:15.870
OK.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.280
Very nice.

01:18.290 --> 01:18.970
It's loading.

01:19.210 --> 01:19.750
That's fine.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.510
We can play with this forever, but that's totally fine.

01:22.540 --> 01:27.670
So by the way, if you look at linear progress indicator, there are a few things you can add or pass

01:27.670 --> 01:28.270
around, right?

01:28.270 --> 01:34.390
So can you pass the modifier, of course, and pass a background color or even the color as well?

01:34.600 --> 01:35.860
There are a lot of things you can do.

01:36.950 --> 01:37.210
OK.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.030
All right, we're not going to spend too much time on that because that's something you can do yourself,

01:41.030 --> 01:46.400
but at least we know now we were able to get the information about at least to get the book.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.780
So if we can get the book, we can extract all sort of things.

01:51.740 --> 01:54.470
OK, so what we really want to do.

01:54.530 --> 01:57.340
Obviously, it's not just to show the book like this.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.810
We want to show something a little bit more concrete like this.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.790
OK, so we're going to have an image of that book.

02:03.830 --> 02:06.500
We're going to have the title of the book and a lot of information.

02:06.500 --> 02:12.440
Now I do realize that there's a lot of information and probably there would be a best way to construct

02:12.500 --> 02:12.920
this user.

02:12.920 --> 02:17.600
You are this user interface, but we just want to get the data in that way.

02:17.780 --> 02:20.780
You also get a chance to make this more beautiful.

02:21.440 --> 02:21.770
All right.

02:22.160 --> 02:22.550
Very good.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.780
So let's go ahead and do that.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.460
First of all, we're going to get the image in the, you know, how to do that by now.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.830
So can parses feed you and go ahead and do that.

02:31.220 --> 02:35.780
And maybe you can just do this entire create this entire screen here.

02:35.810 --> 02:36.470
It's very simple.

02:36.470 --> 02:41.330
So we just adding all of this information into our screen here.

02:42.110 --> 02:46.090
One thing to know exactly where we are getting this information from.

02:46.100 --> 02:53.390
So let's go back to and find book API or books API that is noticed that we can pass the idea of the

02:53.390 --> 02:54.860
book after volume.

02:54.870 --> 03:00.680
So if you go back to our Google API, here you see we have volumes and in this case we're acquiring.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.710
So we have a question mark and queue is equal to Android.

03:03.710 --> 03:11.630
So whatever we add here, let's say dancing like this, it's going to go ahead and pass it around and

03:11.630 --> 03:14.810
get the information about dancing books on dancing.

03:15.200 --> 03:15.470
OK.

03:15.980 --> 03:18.290
But let me get this ad copy this.

03:18.620 --> 03:27.680
So if I change this set of volumes like this point for a slash and did hit enter, then we hit somewhere

03:27.680 --> 03:34.610
else so we can see now we're just going to see the information about that book that has this ad.

03:35.570 --> 03:39.470
So, you know, this is going to be the same thing that we had before, which is going to be volume

03:39.470 --> 03:40.070
info.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.330
It's just that now it's very much specialized for this book.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.770
The fields are all the same.

03:46.070 --> 03:53.180
So you see that you can get title authors and publish data and everything description and so forth.

03:53.510 --> 03:54.920
So that's where it's all coming from.

03:55.070 --> 03:56.550
Just want to show you that let's go back.

03:56.990 --> 03:57.290
Right?

03:57.920 --> 03:59.870
Well, like I said, this is not what we want.

04:00.170 --> 04:04.940
We actually want to pass here details like this.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.730
So I'm going to pass a book, ebook info such.

04:09.650 --> 04:13.280
And then we're passing enough controller like this.

04:13.370 --> 04:15.080
Let's go ahead and create that real quick.

04:15.390 --> 04:16.250
It's composable.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.400
We have everything.

04:18.410 --> 04:23.840
So first I'm going to just extract a few things for my say book data.

04:24.770 --> 04:31.220
When I say book info in this case, that data, I'm going to say volume info.

04:31.580 --> 04:40.850
It's just to get the root of our note and then foul Google Book ID.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.170
We're going to use that later.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.850
Let's say book data, a book info that is.

04:48.180 --> 04:51.120
That data actually just go directly to.

04:52.390 --> 04:59.560
Yes, data, no book I info, OK, the wrong one and get the I.D. I S..

05:00.220 --> 05:01.900
So next claim credit card.

05:02.170 --> 05:03.550
Give it modifier here.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.560
Give about 34 dpi.

05:14.150 --> 05:18.680
And let's also give a shape.

05:20.050 --> 05:27.700
I'm going to circle shaped like this or pass an elevation of about four deep.

05:29.080 --> 05:29.380
All right.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.270
So the first thing I'm going to add, of course, is the events.

05:32.290 --> 05:38.200
The book image is very simple now it's almost like repeating ourselves here.

05:38.290 --> 05:42.520
So image painter and former painter, I'm going to use Coyle.

05:42.580 --> 05:45.250
Remember image painter?

05:46.420 --> 05:47.080
It's going to be.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.250
It's going to be data.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.740
And how do I get that data?

05:50.770 --> 05:59.740
Well, I'm going to get that data from our book data and get to image links and get your thumbnail.

06:01.150 --> 06:01.480
OK?

06:02.410 --> 06:10.510
And so two string looks like it needs more than not, necessarily.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.880
You no longer need that string.

06:13.030 --> 06:13.390
All right.

06:14.270 --> 06:16.060
And description, it's going to be.

06:17.550 --> 06:18.840
I say book image.

06:23.570 --> 06:23.750
Thank.

06:27.110 --> 06:32.270
Let's pass a modifier gave a width of about 90 dpi.

06:34.780 --> 06:44.450
And a height of about 90 dpi and padding of one dpi such weight.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.640
So that is our card.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.300
If we run this over, we're going to see an image.

06:49.930 --> 06:50.890
Let's pick any book.

06:52.210 --> 06:56.260
Well, you, sir, it's happening by this guy.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.160
And there we go running.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.490
There's books about running about that one.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.890
And well, looks good.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.890
Now let's go ahead and add this text here.

07:05.890 --> 07:06.490
The title.

07:06.820 --> 07:10.710
I'm going to go outside of that card round card there.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.740
Let's say text.

07:13.720 --> 07:19.720
And this is just about taking data in putting inside their data title.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.680
Such I'm going to give a style.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.180
Age four, about age six.

07:34.550 --> 07:40.910
Make sure that overflow, I'm going to say I want this to be ellipses in cases that we have a lot of

07:41.340 --> 07:43.490
long title like needs more.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.160
The string, OK, there we go.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.850
And the Max line.

07:53.020 --> 07:58.000
My lines, I'm going to say 19, because some books have very long titles.

07:58.030 --> 07:58.540
Who knows?

07:59.140 --> 08:01.090
And the rest, I'm just going to get.

08:01.990 --> 08:08.350
And you're going to pause this video and get all of the other texts here because it makes no sense.

08:08.710 --> 08:10.540
Let you watch me type all of that.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.470
And there we go.

08:11.500 --> 08:15.970
So we have Arthur's page count and everything is there in what I'm going to do next.

08:15.980 --> 08:21.790
I'm going to add an spacer to give some space between where we're going to add indeed the description.

08:34.540 --> 08:35.230
Let's give it a run.

08:39.390 --> 08:39.720
All right.

08:39.990 --> 08:43.110
It looks it looks good, a little bit cramped, but that's OK.

08:44.110 --> 08:44.590
That's OK.

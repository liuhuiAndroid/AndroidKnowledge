WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:06.230
So we are done now with our fee model, which was pretty much the last piece.

00:06.680 --> 00:13.190
So now we are ready to use a view model where it's appropriate and hopefully save something to our database

00:13.430 --> 00:18.980
and then hopefully also retrieve that something in our user interface and our comparables.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.640
So that is very simple when we add a new CD.

00:22.770 --> 00:27.230
What will happen is we want to add a heart icon as a seat like that.

00:27.380 --> 00:28.970
And to top it there in our eye bar.

00:29.600 --> 00:36.680
And then when they save users, click on their app icon or rather they click on the heart.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.330
That will trigger to say that we want to save the city, right?

00:42.240 --> 00:46.560
Into our database, into our favorites database or table.

00:47.100 --> 00:47.370
OK.

00:48.150 --> 00:48.870
That's the idea.

00:49.590 --> 00:55.260
Which means then when we go back into our favorites, right when we show.

00:55.290 --> 00:56.670
Let's see here real quick.

00:59.230 --> 01:04.180
When we go back and click on our Favorites dropdown menu, there we're going to be.

01:05.180 --> 01:08.720
Looking at when we go, be able to see.

01:10.360 --> 01:16.090
This favorite added that city that we just added showing here, where are we going to be able to delete

01:16.480 --> 01:19.180
that favorite city if we need to do so?

01:20.020 --> 01:27.490
And also when we click that favorite, we want to go back to our main screen and retrieve the data,

01:27.640 --> 01:32.520
the information, the weather, the weather information about that city.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.570
So that is the structure we are going to be putting together here.

01:37.690 --> 01:44.140
So that means that we have to go back, of course, to our App Bar, Weather, App Bar and add this

01:44.140 --> 01:44.770
structure here.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.040
That's very simple.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.460
Of course we've seen that before.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.620
Let's go to our app bar.

01:52.850 --> 01:54.720
I don't see it from here.

01:54.740 --> 01:55.240
It's OK.

01:58.790 --> 02:02.270
Let's go to Maine, I think it's much easier Maine screen.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.500
And then.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.230
There is not bar.

02:10.410 --> 02:11.100
Click on that.

02:11.490 --> 02:17.790
OK, so that means that in our our bar here, what are we going to do is I'm going to pass after our

02:17.790 --> 02:21.270
nav controller, I'm going to pass the few models and say, if you model.

02:25.980 --> 02:31.770
I say favorite view model like this, it's much better, and I'm going to go ahead and instantiate it

02:31.770 --> 02:35.220
right away is going to be built few model as such.

02:36.470 --> 02:42.590
OK, now the beauty, because it's instantiated like there's that means whatever we call this weather

02:42.590 --> 02:45.740
app, I don't have to pass it along, right?

02:46.010 --> 02:52.190
Notice that if we save this everywhere that it's called, I don't feel, Oh, there is no need for us

02:52.190 --> 02:56.600
to pass that along or even call it right because it's instantiated here.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.250
That way, it's fine.

02:58.370 --> 03:01.970
So we can actually use inside here instead of our weather app bar.

03:03.300 --> 03:10.890
We have to remember that this only shows on main screen, that means because we know that our weather

03:10.890 --> 03:17.670
app bar was created, so that is customizable, meaning we can use it anywhere we want by customizing

03:18.000 --> 03:19.050
a few things here and there.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.730
If you scroll down, you'll see that we have a place where we check.

03:25.650 --> 03:32.430
If it's main screen, here you go, if it's main screen, that's actually where we want to show this

03:32.430 --> 03:33.540
heart icon.

03:35.110 --> 03:36.200
So let's see.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.240
Let's go ahead and look, where are we going to position this icon there?

03:40.690 --> 03:44.080
So back to our weather app bar.

03:45.790 --> 03:49.540
Let's scroll down until we find or says navigation icon.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.220
So we have an if statement here.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.230
If there's an icon, it's not at all.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.450
We're going to add some sort of an icon there.

03:55.780 --> 04:01.120
So what I'm going to do after this if statement there, of course, want to create another if statement

04:01.120 --> 04:03.340
here because I want to check a few things.

04:05.270 --> 04:10.340
First of all, this has to happen if is main sponsor is Maine is true, we are in Maine screen.

04:10.350 --> 04:13.910
This is the only place I want this to happen, right?

04:13.910 --> 04:18.290
To have this, this icon there, the heart icon favorite icon.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.120
So I'm going to check if that's true.

04:20.600 --> 04:25.490
OK, if that's true, then I'm going to.

04:26.750 --> 04:31.670
Then I'm going to show the icons and I say icon Mitch Painter.

04:32.030 --> 04:36.050
I'm going to see icons default, you know, one of the favorite.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.640
Can use border, that's fine.

04:39.060 --> 04:45.450
And this is going to be fave favorite icon for our description.

04:48.280 --> 04:48.550
Right.

04:51.790 --> 04:55.270
OK, we can also pass in modified here to modify things are long.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.160
And I'm going to clip.

05:09.290 --> 05:10.310
They're going to scale.

05:12.740 --> 05:19.850
Let's go ahead and scale this to zero nine f like this.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.570
And I also want to make this clickable because, you know, we need that so we can save.

05:26.630 --> 05:26.870
All right.

05:27.770 --> 05:28.430
Let's see.

05:31.840 --> 05:36.580
And for now, that's fine, let's go ahead and run real quick so we can see that logic actually is going

05:36.580 --> 05:38.290
to give us what are we looking for?

05:42.240 --> 05:46.500
It's been a while since we opened or run this app, so let's see.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.090
All right.

05:53.120 --> 05:58.250
It ran fine, and there is that very nice heart icon, as you see there.

05:59.610 --> 05:59.910
OK.

06:00.950 --> 06:01.640
It looks good.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.940
Now, the reason why you see that we have it's a little bit different actually from this is because

06:07.940 --> 06:09.620
we I'm using something different here.

06:10.970 --> 06:14.300
So here I can not to change any sort of border to just say favorite.

06:15.260 --> 06:20.780
If you want to be exactly like what we had, what do we have here?

06:21.170 --> 06:23.060
You just put favorite like this.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.000
And of course, I will have to.

06:35.160 --> 06:35.480
OK.

06:35.730 --> 06:36.930
It's there.

06:37.410 --> 06:43.380
That's the color, but we can change also the tent collars, if you have over after a modifier, we

06:43.380 --> 06:44.340
can pass a tent.

06:44.820 --> 06:53.030
So right there I can say tent color can say color red and then a copy.

06:53.050 --> 06:59.910
Just change the alpha channel here to about 0.6.

07:02.820 --> 07:05.130
OK, this one more time real quick so we can see.

07:06.530 --> 07:07.550
How this will work.

07:07.940 --> 07:08.480
We'll look.

07:14.270 --> 07:17.660
OK, now it looks similar exactly like this.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.430
Either way, whatever you want.

07:19.830 --> 07:20.650
That's terrifying.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.690
I'm just going to show you a few options there and you make the decision.

07:24.530 --> 07:26.450
OK, there we go now.

07:29.480 --> 07:34.400
Once we have the structure and we have the clickable event there where we can then click something,

07:34.400 --> 07:35.020
this will happen.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.200
What is that we want to happen?

07:36.590 --> 07:46.160
Well, we want to insert into our favorite class and our favorite table entity, sort of two things

07:46.160 --> 07:48.620
write one, insert the city and the country.

07:48.710 --> 07:49.400
How do we do that?

07:49.730 --> 07:55.280
Well, look how simple this is because we are passing along our favorite view model.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.030
I can just use our favorite fuel model here.

07:59.540 --> 08:00.680
So favorite view model.

08:00.980 --> 08:07.370
You can say die and invoke to insert favorite and pass a favorite object.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.520
Well, I can create a favorite object right now here.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.130
And if ever object needs two parameters, two arguments for one is the city.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.020
How do I get to city?

08:18.440 --> 08:19.370
Well, here's the thing.

08:21.760 --> 08:28.480
To get the city, we have access to our city, the great thing is that we have this city sitting there

08:29.710 --> 08:36.070
no pun intended because this is the title that we get, which is the city and of course, the country.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.970
So this is going to serve us really well because remember, we have access to it.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.480
It's here as a title that every passing around.

08:44.480 --> 08:44.760
Right.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.630
This title there and so forth.

08:48.960 --> 08:55.750
So really, what we can do, we can split this city into two things.

08:55.830 --> 09:01.380
One is the city name, and the second part is going to be the country code.

09:03.130 --> 09:06.490
Oh, look at that, we using our smarts for good.

09:10.970 --> 09:20.000
OK, so back here, what I'm going to do well, I'm going to use tidal and say split like this and we're

09:20.000 --> 09:25.590
split from where we have comma, right, split from where we have that comma there.

09:26.990 --> 09:33.680
And once we do that, what I want to do is I want to get the first item from our comma.

09:34.740 --> 09:39.060
All right, so in this case, I'm just getting San Diego right.

09:40.820 --> 09:46.310
And then the next, which is going to be country like this.

09:46.400 --> 09:52.580
Remember, we're inside of our favorite instantiated favorite object there for a country here, I'm

09:52.580 --> 09:53.480
going to pass again.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.400
Tile say split.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.890
Do the same thing.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.130
Actually, I don't even have to split anymore what I can do.

10:01.430 --> 10:02.090
Look at this.

10:02.570 --> 10:04.220
We are programmers, so we can.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.070
I can just extract this.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.610
So we can reuse it sort of factor.

10:18.900 --> 10:19.770
Extract that.

10:21.610 --> 10:22.120
There you go.

10:22.270 --> 10:25.690
You can see now, says City, right?

10:32.320 --> 10:40.210
And I can go further to say instead of getting just the key, I'm just going to split savvy in this

10:40.210 --> 10:40.690
case.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.650
Data analyst call it there, because this is going to be when we split something right, we're going

10:51.650 --> 10:53.030
to have an array, right?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.420
So we're going to have an array that will have index zero.

10:56.510 --> 11:01.790
The city index one is going to be the tied to the country code.

11:02.270 --> 11:08.690
So I'm going to just use that now data list and get the zero part.

11:09.080 --> 11:14.270
And for the country, I'm going to data list and get the second part of their right.

11:15.420 --> 11:15.690
All right.

11:16.290 --> 11:19.650
So this is going to be city name,

11:23.070 --> 11:24.210
country code.

11:26.300 --> 11:26.960
And we have it.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.330
Is this true?

11:34.360 --> 11:38.830
Well, let's test it out, see if this works to save this.

11:39.940 --> 11:40.480
Let's run.

11:50.470 --> 11:51.430
OK, there we go.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.510
I'm going to click here.

11:53.500 --> 11:53.880
Click.

11:54.820 --> 11:58.600
Hopefully, San Diego was indeed saved.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.780
And we're going to open look at.

12:07.750 --> 12:08.530
And you can see.

12:09.540 --> 12:12.090
That first was empty, our faves.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.330
And now we have favorite who have an actual object.

12:15.510 --> 12:17.400
San Diego Country USA.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.650
I remember this we added that into I believe or view model, is that true?

12:23.660 --> 12:26.060
Yes, I got faves.

12:26.420 --> 12:32.120
It's giving it a list, the value that we have in our list, which in this case a list containing a

12:32.120 --> 12:33.050
favorite object.

12:33.170 --> 12:37.400
In this case, San Diego has city and country USA, so it's working.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.320
If I go somewhere else in search for Seattle.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.520
And here I'm going to click.

12:46.470 --> 12:54.690
And we will see that now, country, we have San Diego waiting faves, and for another favorite, we

12:54.690 --> 12:56.880
have Seattle and the country USA, USA.

12:57.240 --> 13:01.830
If I decide, perhaps just to be more inclusive Moscow.

13:05.040 --> 13:05.300
OK.

13:05.490 --> 13:11.850
Let's save it saved, and you can see now it's getting the information from a database because you can

13:12.630 --> 13:17.340
because we actually are saving something Moscow City Country, Russia.

13:19.070 --> 13:19.910
Wonderful.

13:20.060 --> 13:20.970
It's working.

13:20.990 --> 13:21.770
Yay.

13:23.000 --> 13:23.600
OK.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.380
Wow.

13:26.620 --> 13:29.440
A lot of work for little reward.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.140
No, I'm kidding.

13:30.160 --> 13:38.130
This is a huge thing and we are able or we were able to put the infrastructure from the beginning together,

13:38.230 --> 13:38.590
right?

13:38.890 --> 13:45.220
We started slow small, the first structure here, room database, Dow, Single Identity and everything.

13:45.220 --> 13:49.360
And then we moved on to creating repository and view model.

13:49.360 --> 13:55.870
And now we are here kind of really in a way in that we are able to save things to our database.

13:56.110 --> 14:00.820
And if we can say things sort of the ways and means we are able to retrieve those things in this case,

14:01.120 --> 14:04.870
our favorite list of cities and so forth.

14:05.360 --> 14:14.240
OK, so the main goal is going to be to show that in our favorites, this what we have here, right?

14:14.290 --> 14:15.880
So that's what I'm going to be doing next.

14:16.150 --> 14:22.680
We're going to go back and look our favorite composable or screen and start putting together this structure.

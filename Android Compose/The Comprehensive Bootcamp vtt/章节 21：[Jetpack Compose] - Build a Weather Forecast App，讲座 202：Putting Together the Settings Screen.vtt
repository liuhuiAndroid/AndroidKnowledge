WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:06.920
All right, so let's continue Settings View Settings screen here, so we have a top part in for a top.

00:06.960 --> 00:12.270
Are we going to use you as I use warm, whether I bar?

00:12.960 --> 00:13.740
There it is.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.240
Has our controller?

00:19.040 --> 00:20.510
NAF controller that is.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.180
And.

00:26.490 --> 00:29.340
Before that, let's go ahead and pass a few other.

00:31.210 --> 00:37.990
Arguments with Title said that two settings and icon.

00:47.290 --> 00:52.540
Is main is going to be this false, because it's not the main screen.

00:53.350 --> 00:56.990
All right now inside of our scaffold.

00:57.370 --> 01:00.120
This is what we're going to create this structure here.

01:00.130 --> 01:03.190
As you see, there is really there isn't that much.

01:03.550 --> 01:07.780
OK, so let's go ahead and put together the structure surface.

01:15.490 --> 01:16.450
Max with.

01:20.150 --> 01:21.110
Max Height.

01:32.220 --> 01:33.900
Add a column here.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.480
I prefer to call

01:42.320 --> 01:43.340
arrangement.

01:46.260 --> 01:46.990
Sandra?

01:53.520 --> 01:57.780
Alignments and our horizontally, and I'm going to add a text.

02:01.380 --> 02:02.310
Let's change.

02:10.070 --> 02:11.480
Mortar fire.

02:15.610 --> 02:23.650
Padding bottom can give about 15 deep a good.

02:25.540 --> 02:32.470
Then after a text, what I'm going to do is I'm going to add what I call what I'm going to do.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.690
Let's go ahead and add this button here.

02:34.700 --> 02:40.890
So this is actually going to be a different kind of button called icon toggle button.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.390
So let's go ahead and have that real quick.

02:45.790 --> 02:51.190
I'm going to create later a state variable that will allow us to tabulate back and forth, right?

02:51.550 --> 03:02.220
Don't say unit toggle status, such as having created and then on change here.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.670
We're going to do some work.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.410
Let's go ahead and create this unit tackle there.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.200
So again, it's going to be a.

03:13.110 --> 03:13.890
Stateful.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.730
Or a state right at the top here.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.340
I have to import a few things.

03:25.850 --> 03:26.070
Go.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.910
And I can't also.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.090
Put that in single lambda.

03:35.640 --> 03:41.460
And then here I'm going to create a list of two strains called vowel measurement.

03:45.810 --> 03:49.140
Units list of.

03:55.340 --> 04:05.390
Looks like it's going to be a real laugh like this second five Fahrenheit and metric.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.220
See, four Celsius.

04:12.150 --> 04:19.530
And because this will toggle back and forth between Celsius and Fahrenheit, I need to add another state

04:19.740 --> 04:23.730
here called Choice State, which will use we'll see in a second.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.360
And let's say choice.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.300
State.

04:37.180 --> 04:42.720
So I remember facilitate everything immutable state of.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.400
It's going to be a string.

04:51.310 --> 04:53.060
All right, now, let's go back here now.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.900
You can see that all looks much better.

04:56.320 --> 04:56.980
So what is it?

04:56.980 --> 05:02.830
I want to do well on checked change, meaning once we click, we're checking, we're changing the state

05:03.280 --> 05:05.470
of our eye going toggle button, right?

05:05.470 --> 05:09.910
And we toggle back and forth, depending on the state of our type of state unit there.

05:10.270 --> 05:14.140
So inside here, we're going to get a bulletin as you see it there so we can check.

05:14.350 --> 05:15.310
We're going to do something here.

05:15.700 --> 05:22.480
So first, actually, and when I say unit toggle test, let's set that to the opposite of it.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.030
Right.

05:23.080 --> 05:31.390
So toggling back and forth so you can toggle test, let's say, what does it like it like change to

05:31.390 --> 05:33.100
the right subject to changing it?

05:33.340 --> 05:33.760
It's fine.

05:34.090 --> 05:41.140
And then I'm going to put an if statement here that I'm going to say, you know, titles test state.

05:41.140 --> 05:46.870
That is, if it's true, then I am going to say choice.

05:47.110 --> 05:53.500
State said that to the actual value, which is not the imperial.

05:56.580 --> 05:57.540
Half like this.

06:01.820 --> 06:11.270
Let's also make this half hour because we're changing the variable, and then else I'm going to make

06:11.270 --> 06:17.450
sure that our choice state value is in this case metrics and put this in a line.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.050
So was a metric.

06:23.670 --> 06:24.750
See like that.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.260
Let's not forget the finalize or else if.

06:29.510 --> 06:33.740
All right, so now inside here, this is where I'm going to create this structure, of course, inside

06:34.080 --> 06:36.110
can create a text and so forth.

06:36.590 --> 06:49.430
So, uh, before that, let's modify four things for our tackle button now or the fire feel max width,

06:49.430 --> 06:58.400
and I'm going to put a fraction to say, I want this to shrink using this fraction here zero point five

06:58.400 --> 06:59.440
f right.

07:00.590 --> 07:01.730
The width in this case.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.810
And then I'm going to clip.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.680
Has a shape to say what shape I want this to look to have slightly rectangle.

07:21.550 --> 07:26.110
Rectangle shape and then padding.

07:26.470 --> 07:34.810
It's going to be about five dpi and then background, let's say color, my gender

07:38.530 --> 07:39.790
and pass alpha.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.870
Zero point four F.

07:46.580 --> 07:46.910
All right.

07:46.970 --> 07:52.100
Just to change things a little bit to give this kind of, in fact, if you don't like this color, you

07:52.100 --> 07:53.310
can pass it any other time.

07:53.380 --> 07:53.780
It's fine.

07:54.140 --> 07:54.440
All right.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.030
And let's see what else we have to do.

07:57.050 --> 07:59.450
Now we're going to add the actual text, right?

08:01.370 --> 08:05.240
So it looks like all this, remember, need more to be imported and do that.

08:08.270 --> 08:08.490
All right.

08:08.690 --> 08:09.490
What's going on here?

08:09.650 --> 08:10.760
I just had a text.

08:14.140 --> 08:19.690
And for this tax here, what I want to do now, I'm going to check because depending on how this works,

08:19.690 --> 08:25.300
whether we clicked first time or second time, we want to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, right?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.140
That's the idea.

08:26.650 --> 08:31.120
So I'm going put an if statement here and say if this actually has been sacked there.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.330
So if unit.

08:37.720 --> 08:43.660
Toggle state, it's true, then I'm going to say Fahrenheit.

08:47.800 --> 09:01.750
I think that's how you spell it, put effort like this else, Celsius has to be inside like that.

09:05.060 --> 09:06.500
So they decide that when we click.

09:06.770 --> 09:09.890
Of course, the toggle state will change along, right?

09:10.220 --> 09:18.440
So if in this case, the if our, you know, toggle state is true, then choice is going to imperial,

09:18.710 --> 09:19.940
else is going to be a metric.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.020
That's what are we doing here.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.200
So if it's imperial, that means it's Fahrenheit.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.820
If it's not, which means this metric, Celsius, that's what we are trying to get there.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.460
All right, let's go ahead and run this real quick.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.260
All right.

09:40.290 --> 09:42.660
Let's go to settings, I'm on my phone here.

09:43.590 --> 09:44.690
All right, there we go.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.840
So if I click right, it's changing back and forth.

09:47.850 --> 09:49.020
Fahrenheit Celsius.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.270
Fahrenheit Celsius, right?

09:51.720 --> 09:54.720
So that's exactly what we want and it's working.

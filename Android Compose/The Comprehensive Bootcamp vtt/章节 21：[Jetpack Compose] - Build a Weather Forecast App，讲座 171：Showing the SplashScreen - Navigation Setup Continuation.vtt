00:02.280 --> 00:06.300
So we have a weather navigation, you can see that we haven't used it anywhere.

00:06.420 --> 00:07.410
So how do we use that?

00:07.530 --> 00:09.060
Well, we have to go to our main activity.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.680
This is where everything is.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.030
It's called posÃ©.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.070
All right, so in our main activity here, I'm going to restructure a few things.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.600
First of all, I'm going to get rid of all of this.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.980
And because now we got rid of that.

00:23.100 --> 00:29.700
That means our greetings is going to go away, which is OK because that's just boilerplate code that

00:29.700 --> 00:30.270
we don't want.

00:30.510 --> 00:33.360
OK, so first, I'm going to structure this a little bit different.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.860
I'm going to create a function here.

00:34.860 --> 00:44.490
Actually, let's make this a composable first and then it's called this weather app like that.

00:45.570 --> 00:52.680
And what I'm going to do is let's get rid of all of that, in fact, and we get all of this out here.

00:55.890 --> 00:56.370
OK.

00:56.400 --> 00:56.880
Very good.

01:02.830 --> 01:10.690
And I'm going to make it the surface here, I'm going to pass a modifier and then we say, fill max

01:10.690 --> 01:21.400
with and if I want to kill two birds with one stone, I know that's a very rough wording, but it works,

01:21.400 --> 01:22.450
meaning that I want to.

01:22.720 --> 01:29.620
I just say fill max size, which will take care of everything height and width.

01:30.070 --> 01:31.140
OK, there we go.

01:31.150 --> 01:35.230
So now we are saying the whole surface is going to take up the entire space of this great.

01:37.070 --> 01:37.480
All right.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.190
So inside here, now I'm going to create a column.

01:41.390 --> 01:41.650
OK.

01:42.380 --> 01:48.500
And I must say vertical arrangement and sea arrangement center.

01:49.490 --> 01:50.270
And

01:53.630 --> 01:55.630
let's say horizontal alignment.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.040
I'm going to say alignment center, horizontal like that.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.730
And here is where I'm going to call this other.

02:02.790 --> 02:09.510
Composable called weather navigation, which we created, which is which one this guy here.

02:10.840 --> 02:15.700
So what we're doing now is that the moment we call weather app, which we're not calling anywhere,

02:16.360 --> 02:17.560
yes, we're going to call it here.

02:18.490 --> 02:25.300
Weather app, such so the moment we call Weather App, Weather app will know that, OK, it's going

02:25.300 --> 02:30.220
to call the weather forecast theme passing the surface and everything we've done there.

02:30.550 --> 02:35.080
And then most importantly then is going to set up our weather navigation and we know that our weather

02:35.080 --> 02:41.870
navigation has the nav controller in this case, the Alarm Pranav controller it has now hosted.

02:41.940 --> 02:48.380
At this point, we only have one composable, which is the splash screen, and it knows enough nav host

02:48.380 --> 02:51.700
that should say it knows where to start.

02:51.730 --> 02:58.060
He knows that we start at the splash screen and of course composable is called and then we should see

02:58.240 --> 02:59.020
the splash screen.

03:00.350 --> 03:03.700
This is how we set up our navigation no app.

03:04.070 --> 03:09.600
Now it's important to start with their navigation because everything else comes after that.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.430
In my opinion.

03:10.640 --> 03:10.910
Right.

03:11.450 --> 03:16.460
Instead of building out the entire application with no navigation, I like to start with their navigation

03:16.460 --> 03:22.640
first so that it's much easier because we can start adding all of that is screens as we go through,

03:22.820 --> 03:23.090
right?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.560
We said of our nav host.

03:24.920 --> 03:29.260
We only have one composable here, one screen, right?

03:29.270 --> 03:30.770
One destination, if you will.

03:31.250 --> 03:37.330
But obviously, we're going to add more destinations later because we've created a few screens here.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.470
We have main screen about screen and so forth.

03:41.230 --> 03:41.560
OK.

03:43.130 --> 03:47.510
Very well, now, moment of truth, let's go ahead and run this app real quick.

03:47.590 --> 03:50.890
Hopefully, we can see something working during this run.

03:53.920 --> 04:00.850
Now, remember, I do have an actual device that is running in your case, you would have an emulator

04:00.850 --> 04:06.610
and so forth, but I have a device which will be prompt to work in a second here.

04:07.390 --> 04:13.150
And if all goes well on your emulator or on your device, you will see we have a splash screen.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.910
That means then our navigation works.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.160
Congratulations if you got to this point.

04:18.310 --> 04:23.170
Now, if you're not having problems, remember you have to follow exactly what we did before.

04:23.650 --> 04:29.110
Number one, you have to make sure that we have all the dependencies we created or I showed you earlier

04:29.110 --> 04:30.130
how to put it together.

04:30.520 --> 04:35.650
And you know where to go to get all that information, go to GitHub, the repo that I've shown you earlier.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.780
That's very, very important.

04:36.790 --> 04:37.360
Otherwise.

04:38.020 --> 04:41.350
Unfortunately, things are not going to work and then follow exactly what I did.

04:41.500 --> 04:46.990
Like creating, of course, enough controller in this case, the weather or navigation, and make sure

04:46.990 --> 04:49.690
we passing the starting point and so forth.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.520
It's very important.

04:51.910 --> 04:53.800
OK, so we are making real good progress.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.840
Obviously, this is not what we want.

04:55.930 --> 05:02.950
What we want to happen is we want to have a splash screen that looks something like this.

05:03.190 --> 05:06.130
It's something that is a little bit more, has a little bit more pizzazz.

05:06.130 --> 05:14.110
And most importantly, we're going to add a animation so that we have that splash screen look and feel.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.240
And that's what we're going to be doing next.

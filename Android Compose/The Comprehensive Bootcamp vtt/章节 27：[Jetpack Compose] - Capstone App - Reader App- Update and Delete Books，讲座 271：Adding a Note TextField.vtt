WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:01.410
All right, let's go ahead and continue.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.760
Now we are going to add at least this text field.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.400
Yeah, I'm going to actually call it show simple.

00:12.340 --> 00:21.790
Form because we need that form, and I'm going to pass the book, which is going to be view model data

00:25.060 --> 00:26.920
and just get the first one.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.250
Parts of the land and air cook and book.

00:36.580 --> 00:44.380
And here, amnesty and book, of course, another credited here here Google idea is equal to book Item

00:44.380 --> 00:47.700
I.D. So make sure that I'm getting the correct book here.

00:47.730 --> 00:48.010
OK.

00:51.460 --> 00:57.580
And what I need to do next, I'm going to pass a knife controller looks very strange because we haven't

00:57.580 --> 00:58.500
created anything about it.

00:58.510 --> 00:59.470
Let's go ahead and create that.

00:59.830 --> 01:06.310
And I like doing this because then it's it's way simpler for us to create the actual composer composable

01:06.640 --> 01:10.300
as you see it passes and all of the parameters that we need.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.730
Very, very handy here.

01:12.730 --> 01:16.090
I'm going to actually create another simple form.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.400
OK, so I'm done here.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.290
I'm going to create a simple form.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.710
Add composable font called it simple.

01:27.070 --> 01:31.390
Form such and I'm going to pass modifier.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.420
And Louis Bass loading bullion, which now going to you, which we're not going to use, but I'm going

01:45.510 --> 01:47.670
to pass it in a way so we can have that.

01:47.680 --> 01:55.050
I'm going to put default values can be a strain and be a great book.

01:57.610 --> 02:00.820
And then on a search like this.

02:03.150 --> 02:04.620
The passive strain.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.310
And it's just been a unit.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.730
So the simple form we're going to call inside here, simple form.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.660
And we're going to get to it.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.780
OK, so what do I want in the simple form?

02:19.840 --> 02:25.590
Well, let's put a column first and then here, let's create a few variables.

02:25.640 --> 02:33.940
So let's text field value from number save singable.

02:33.940 --> 02:36.910
That is an immutable state.

02:39.420 --> 02:43.450
Of passenger default value, right?

02:44.310 --> 02:45.330
It, you know, the state.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.280
Involve a keyboard controller.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.980
Local soft keyboard controller that current.

03:03.080 --> 03:11.000
And then it's not right, this one here, we have to add the experimental, composable composed like

03:11.000 --> 03:11.330
that.

03:13.320 --> 03:24.270
And so a valid just to check and say, remember going to use our text field to value the value, to

03:24.270 --> 03:35.970
do the calculations here in the text field value, that value trim is not empty like that, it's not

03:35.970 --> 03:36.510
empty.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.340
This is going to be true and we can use that.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.000
This has to be outside.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.320
That's why this OK.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.670
Right now, I'm going to use an input field.

03:45.670 --> 03:48.750
They were created before and passed in.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.450
First of all, states are going to be text field.

03:54.040 --> 04:01.840
The label is going to be I say, enter your thoughts, enable just say true.

04:02.170 --> 04:08.290
Then I'm going to pass on action keyboards here to keyboard actions.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.140
Let's just use a lambda.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.650
And what is it we want to do?

04:14.710 --> 04:23.290
First, we're going to check if if it's not valid, then just return keyboards or return nothing, really.

04:23.590 --> 04:30.460
And then I'm going to call the on search, which would then pass our text field value trimmed back value.

04:30.760 --> 04:36.910
And then, of course, the screen and a keyboard controller can hide that like this.

04:37.660 --> 04:45.670
And also in the past, if you like a modifier here, so feel maxed width, give it a height of about

04:45.670 --> 04:52.240
140 dpi and padding of about three dpi.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.000
And also a background color.

04:55.930 --> 05:04.480
I say color white and I can pass circle shape here for the shape.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.470
That's something you can also do and it can continue.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.080
I can say I want to add another padding here of this pattern.

05:11.410 --> 05:16.180
I want horizontal padding to be about 20 dpi.

05:18.130 --> 05:21.430
Vertical to be a 12 DP.

05:21.910 --> 05:24.790
OK, so what are we doing here, just setting up structure there?

05:25.090 --> 05:27.220
All right, let's go to back to our simple form.

05:29.420 --> 05:36.500
And search is going to be actually lamda for us, so I'm just going to put like this and let's pass

05:36.500 --> 05:38.180
a few of the arguments.

05:38.510 --> 05:41.300
So let's add a default value because we need that.

05:41.390 --> 05:43.080
Where do we get that default value?

05:43.100 --> 05:48.050
Well, we're going to put in if statement and say if looked at notes.

05:52.080 --> 06:00.810
Is not empty like that or to make it more beautiful, I can just say, no, it's got to strain.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.530
And then it's not empty.

06:04.770 --> 06:09.780
If that's the case, then I'm just going to say our default values are going to be a book that notes

06:10.050 --> 06:17.190
and to string like this else when I say no thoughts of.

06:18.600 --> 06:25.260
OK, we need to pass the experimental compose UI there, because this simple form, he's using that.

06:25.260 --> 06:30.930
So we need to pass that along as well and here as well and add that.

06:31.380 --> 06:34.080
And here we're going to have our actual note.

06:34.770 --> 06:39.360
It's going to be passed around now because we are going to need the state of that note.

06:39.420 --> 06:42.210
So I'm going to create at the top here.

06:42.450 --> 06:54.780
A vowel notes text to get the actual note put inside of a member and some immutable state of just empty.

06:55.350 --> 07:01.830
And so I'm going to set it up here, so I take notes to extract value and then set it to.

07:03.810 --> 07:07.290
This note or rather, this note sent.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.920
Said, or to this note that we're getting from our form.

07:12.550 --> 07:12.770
OK.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.410
Let's see.

07:15.600 --> 07:21.030
If we run this, we hopefully are going to see something should be able, hopefully to see this.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.100
OK.

07:24.130 --> 07:24.670
Let's see.

07:25.360 --> 07:25.840
Click.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.040
All right.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.240
It looks really great.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.690
We can add a note of it, Anna.

07:32.680 --> 07:38.320
We don't see anything because we didn't add anything to to see what happens when we hit enter.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.940
But at least there we go.

07:40.570 --> 07:46.990
It shows something that is if there is notes that they were left before, we should get those notes

07:46.990 --> 07:47.770
inside here.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.150
OK, that's why we say here.

07:49.390 --> 07:51.930
Look, that notes that string to get that.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.790
If this is empty, then we get that note.

07:55.090 --> 07:57.700
Alice, we are going to say no facts available.

07:58.030 --> 07:58.390
All right.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.560
So great.

07:59.660 --> 07:59.920
Good.

07:59.980 --> 08:04.870
This is good progress, and we're going to continue and add this structure here later.

08:05.170 --> 08:08.890
And then we're going to move on, of course, until we were able to update a note.

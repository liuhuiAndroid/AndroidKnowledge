00:00.360 --> 00:05.010
All right, so before we proceed, I would like to talk about a little topic here of the immolated Android

00:05.010 --> 00:05.490
emulator.

00:05.580 --> 00:12.690
Now this has been something that developers Android developers specifically have talked about for as

00:12.690 --> 00:15.330
long as Android development was a thing.

00:15.600 --> 00:23.010
Meaning that developers have always had to deal with how slow the emulator will is in many cases now.

00:23.370 --> 00:28.290
But of course, things have changed throughout the years because computers have gotten faster, and

00:28.770 --> 00:31.800
the Android Studio also has gotten better and so forth.

00:32.070 --> 00:38.430
But I feel like regardless, you at some point will run into issues or run into problems with using

00:38.610 --> 00:39.720
the Android emulator.

00:39.870 --> 00:40.200
OK.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.870
And it may be that you're not part of this group of people who have problem with Android and later.

00:45.120 --> 00:51.570
But at some point your computer may crash because the Android emulator may take up a lot of memory.

00:52.560 --> 00:59.370
Also, I have to say that if you are getting serious about Android development, at some point you probably

00:59.370 --> 01:04.980
have to invest on an actual Android phone even if you don't already have an Android phone.

01:05.160 --> 01:11.160
OK, I want to say using Android emulator is a great thing, is easy, quick when everything is working

01:11.160 --> 01:11.570
fine.

01:11.910 --> 01:18.480
And so but nothing beats the actual device, the actual physical device that you can actually plug in

01:18.480 --> 01:20.460
into your computer and start testing.

01:21.180 --> 01:26.400
In this video, I want to share with you, how can you connect or how to set up a device for a development

01:26.400 --> 01:28.590
in actual Android device?

01:28.950 --> 01:35.730
Now, as you know, Android as an operating system and mobile operating system runs on a variety of

01:35.730 --> 01:39.660
devices, meaning there's different sizes, different manufacturers and so forth.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.940
That is the beauty of Android, but it gives us a little bit more headaches as developers because now

01:44.940 --> 01:51.000
we have to figure out, OK, now we have to deal with different devices, sizes and manufacturers and

01:51.000 --> 01:51.570
so forth.

01:51.960 --> 01:57.660
So what I'm going to show you here is going to help you depending on what kind of device you have.

01:57.660 --> 02:03.480
And this will also give you a way of troubleshooting when you're trying to set up your device and things

02:03.480 --> 02:04.430
are not quite working.

02:04.470 --> 02:04.800
OK.

02:05.220 --> 02:05.490
All right.

02:05.820 --> 02:10.890
So the first thing I want to show you is that I actually have my device set up and is running, as you

02:10.890 --> 02:11.370
see here.

02:11.370 --> 02:16.010
So this is actually mirroring my actual device.

02:16.020 --> 02:22.470
In fact, as you see here, I'm touching my device and you can see that it's working also there on the

02:22.470 --> 02:22.830
screen.

02:23.250 --> 02:27.810
And in fact, I can put this down and start touching, sorry, using my mouse here and I can do the

02:27.810 --> 02:28.520
same thing, right?

02:28.530 --> 02:34.510
So this is really nice, but it's actually running on my Pixel four device as we speak.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.040
In fact, if I go ahead and click running, in fact, let's just open here.

02:38.310 --> 02:43.860
There's this Pixel four API throw that is this device and this emulator in mind is this one.

02:43.870 --> 02:44.850
So when I run this?

02:47.190 --> 02:52.740
And in a second, you can see the app is running here, so I can go ahead using my phone now.

02:53.430 --> 02:56.730
So tapping and he can see that things are working.

02:56.880 --> 03:02.490
OK, so this is an actual an actual device that I'm I have installed the app and I'm testing it.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.060
The idea here, of course, is so that you have your own device.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.680
You don't have to have this software.

03:07.690 --> 03:13.410
Of course, I'm just using this because I want to show you as I run my app on my device so you can actually

03:13.410 --> 03:17.970
see it because I'm recording this video, but you have to have this, but you could have, of course,

03:17.970 --> 03:20.040
your own device as you develop.

03:20.250 --> 03:27.330
You can then run the app that we testing on to the device, which which should be faster and easier

03:27.660 --> 03:27.900
to do.

03:27.900 --> 03:32.200
So what do we need to do is to go to developer that Android dot com?

03:32.220 --> 03:36.360
This is, of course, that's the holy grail of everything, really.

03:36.690 --> 03:41.190
And if you search, if you go straight to this link, of course you're going to end up here, but you

03:41.190 --> 03:47.370
can always search, debug your app and or how to set up a device for development.

03:48.210 --> 03:50.790
And so most likely, you will end up somewhere here.

03:50.880 --> 03:56.310
OK, you can go for the inside of the overview first to see what's it all about?

03:56.550 --> 04:00.270
And there's a lot of information, and I'm not going to go through all of this because it's something

04:00.270 --> 04:01.500
that you can do yourself.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.260
But let's go to configure developer options.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.290
Click here.

04:05.670 --> 04:10.890
This will give you, of course, all the information you need most important how to enable developer

04:10.890 --> 04:13.050
options and use debugging.

04:13.650 --> 04:13.860
OK.

04:14.490 --> 04:16.620
And gives you exactly the tools.

04:16.620 --> 04:21.570
It gives exactly all these steps, depending on different phones, and they talk about API levels and

04:21.570 --> 04:22.020
so forth.

04:22.320 --> 04:28.710
So that because again, Android so diverse, there may be some differences in the user interface or

04:28.710 --> 04:33.450
in the way we access the settings like developer options and so forth.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.200
OK.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.450
As you see here says, for instance, that to enable developers options because sometimes you won't

04:39.450 --> 04:46.740
have this evolve options as in the settings right to enable it, you have to go to build number and

04:46.740 --> 04:47.820
tap seven times.

04:48.300 --> 04:52.350
And he says you can find this option in one of the following locations, depending on your device.

04:52.650 --> 04:58.650
So depending on your device level, Android level, API level, that is, you will go in and have to

04:58.650 --> 04:59.880
find in different places.

04:59.880 --> 05:07.110
But usually settings go to systems about phone and build number and tap it seven times and then you

05:07.110 --> 05:11.640
should be good, and then you should be able to get to developer options.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.200
OK.

05:13.950 --> 05:17.730
And these developer options, you have to sell it to on, as you see here.

05:17.910 --> 05:24.180
In order for you to be able to then be able to see or at least the Android Studio, be able to recognize

05:24.180 --> 05:29.850
that you indeed have a phone that is connected and ready to be used as a debug phone.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.690
I could see that is also in this course.

05:33.690 --> 05:39.780
I make solely use my own phone, which you should probably end up seeing something like this, but in

05:39.780 --> 05:43.260
your case, you may opt to using the emulator.

05:43.260 --> 05:43.860
That's fine.

05:43.860 --> 05:44.640
It doesn't really matter.

05:44.850 --> 05:51.630
I just want to give you the options so you understand that there are two ways to actually run your run

05:51.630 --> 05:56.760
ended by your apps using your own device, which I actually recommend because it's just better.

WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:05.550
So we know that we were able to save data and our database or favorite objects are being saved, which

00:05.550 --> 00:06.120
is great.

00:06.270 --> 00:09.210
Now we want to show those inside of our favorite screen.

00:09.220 --> 00:12.180
So when to create a structure like this, right?

00:12.210 --> 00:13.020
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.470
Now we already we should have, I believe, already.

00:17.490 --> 00:18.630
Let me get rid of some of these.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.840
Let's go and find a favorite screen.

00:24.380 --> 00:24.800
Very good.

00:25.130 --> 00:25.430
All right.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.680
It's very empty.

00:26.700 --> 00:27.490
Nothing is there.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.040
That's fine.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.300
That's why we're here.

00:29.360 --> 00:33.050
So we have enough control and we're passing and we all need something else.

00:33.380 --> 00:33.980
Guess what?

00:34.350 --> 00:41.270
Yes, you need a favorite view model like this, and I'm going to go ahead and just instantiate it held

00:41.270 --> 00:43.160
view model so we can actually use it.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.520
So I'm going to create a scaffold here.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.160
Nothing really new for a top bar.

00:50.060 --> 00:54.560
I'm going to pass the weather app.

00:56.100 --> 01:04.830
Bar, such I'm going to pass on the controller and I'm also going to pass a few other parameters here

01:04.830 --> 01:06.390
because we can't do that, remember.

01:06.690 --> 01:15.030
That's the reason why we created this nav bar this top, this app bar should call it so that we can

01:15.030 --> 01:15.900
do things like this.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.750
We can customize to our liking.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.920
So it's, say, favorite cities.

01:21.450 --> 01:22.720
Okay for the title.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.050
I'm going to put it an icon here.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.970
You see icons default.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.550
Arrow back good is main screen.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.540
Let's say false, that works as well, it is not main.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.850
And we have enough controller.

01:43.880 --> 01:44.560
That's very good.

01:51.500 --> 01:51.830
OK.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.730
And we make sure here because I know I have that lambda.

01:56.750 --> 02:03.980
So when the back button is click, I'm going to use an IV controller and say Pop back stack.

02:08.430 --> 02:08.720
OK.

02:09.030 --> 02:09.870
Let's see.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.230
Put all in one lambda, that's fine.

02:17.130 --> 02:25.680
OK, so now here is going to be where we add all of this information right to the body of our favorite

02:25.680 --> 02:26.130
cities.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.370
Well, it's going to be very simple.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.500
First of all, let me put a surface here.

02:36.580 --> 02:37.240
What's new?

02:37.930 --> 02:45.010
And I'm going to add a modifier key for padding of a five dpi.

02:45.910 --> 02:47.800
I like to add modifier.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.470
And to Phil Max with.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.010
It's important to our DP there.

03:08.900 --> 03:09.560
And that's good.

03:09.860 --> 03:10.940
Let's add a column.

03:14.020 --> 03:22.720
And for a column, let's start with the vertical alignment or arrangement, I say arrangement, I want

03:22.840 --> 03:23.530
centre

03:28.720 --> 03:29.980
and horizontal.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.350
I'm going to see alignment.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.490
Senator, horizontally.

03:38.780 --> 03:39.860
That's about that.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.560
And here what I'm going to do, I'm going to create a file called this list and I'm going to say few

03:45.560 --> 03:49.430
model or rather our favorite your model.

03:50.150 --> 03:55.400
I'm going to invoke the five list variable, which is the property you remember correctly that we created

03:55.700 --> 03:59.060
right inside of the view model death value.

03:59.060 --> 04:00.620
And I'm going to say collect.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.240
Actually, I don't need to file, I'm going to say that.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.430
And let's go ahead and say, collect a state like this and then get the value.

04:14.120 --> 04:14.590
All right.

04:14.600 --> 04:19.670
So we get the actual state, which remember it's needed for composable because posibles.

04:19.970 --> 04:26.180
They are triggered triggered by data, but most importantly, data that's wrapped inside of a state.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.500
OK, all right.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.000
That's all.

04:29.390 --> 04:30.080
Not really.

04:30.260 --> 04:38.060
When parolees pass a lazy column here and I just going to use that lambda, it's much easier that way

04:38.840 --> 04:44.030
to say items going to use that flavor of items, items.

04:44.030 --> 04:52.790
Of course, in this case, I'm going to set it to our list of items there, a lambda and four lambda

04:52.790 --> 04:53.150
here.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.380
What I'm going to do call this city brew.

04:57.410 --> 05:05.030
I'm going to pass it, which is each one of our favorite objects in the past, our nav controller,

05:07.490 --> 05:14.290
which is our nav controller at the top and also going to pass the favorite view Model S..

05:14.720 --> 05:19.310
All right, let's go ahead and create our city row composable by the bottom here.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.620
I mean, go in and import that, OK?

05:26.540 --> 05:29.210
And sort of it, let's just call this favorite.

05:31.240 --> 05:31.690
That.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.870
Remove the excess and good.

05:36.530 --> 05:40.190
All right, so here we are, just going to create this very simple structure.

05:42.300 --> 05:47.420
You want to create a surface, of course, and passing the modifier.

05:47.870 --> 05:59.380
You were padding about three deep and filled max width and going to give a height of about 50 deep as

05:59.420 --> 05:59.840
such.

06:01.380 --> 06:01.700
Right.

06:02.930 --> 06:07.010
And the other thing I want to make sure that happens is that this is also clickable because we need

06:07.010 --> 06:09.680
to click on that and we're going to come back to that.

06:15.100 --> 06:25.870
So continuing here, I'm going to add the shape of circle shape such I'm going to actually customize

06:25.870 --> 06:28.570
this a little bit to add that pizzazz.

06:28.570 --> 06:35.270
So top end, I'm going to put a corner size corner size there of about 60.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.440
This is just me trying to be fancy.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.500
Nothing really necessary.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.620
But, you know, give it a color here.

06:44.920 --> 06:45.780
Say color.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.680
I'm going to use hex codes.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.080
So zero x f f what alphas and so forth.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.740
B to DfT.

06:56.740 --> 06:58.240
Be like this again?

06:58.240 --> 07:02.380
You can always change by clicking on the color there and change the color.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.430
Very handy.

07:07.770 --> 07:08.640
OK, there we go.

07:09.060 --> 07:14.220
And so now inside of our structure, here are a composed surface.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.850
Let's remove that redundancy there.

07:16.860 --> 07:22.980
I think I already have all the good there and now I'm going to create a row.

07:23.970 --> 07:29.910
Remember just creating this structure now inside there this row?

07:30.630 --> 07:33.270
We're going to make sure I pass a few modifiers here.

07:33.270 --> 07:34.230
So modifier.

07:34.290 --> 07:34.710
Oops.

07:44.920 --> 07:51.700
Phil Max, width and vertical alignment.

07:51.790 --> 07:54.670
I want this to be center vertically.

07:58.870 --> 08:03.310
And horizontal arrangement, I want this to be space evenly.

08:06.340 --> 08:07.660
And that's about it.

08:13.270 --> 08:17.830
And now it's just a matter of adding these text, all of that there.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.300
OK, so we start with a text.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.460
I'm going to use the object favorite because I have access to it.

08:28.480 --> 08:33.520
We're passing it there and I want to get the city property.

08:37.510 --> 08:38.770
Give it a modifier.

08:41.420 --> 08:42.620
I want to give a start.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.540
Start padding here.

08:45.170 --> 08:47.540
Of about four deep.

08:48.620 --> 08:49.700
And that's about it.

08:52.030 --> 08:58.070
And then if you look closely, it looks like I've also added, I do have something else here.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.440
Let's get rid of that.

09:01.210 --> 09:04.810
I have a background and then on top I have the tax.

09:04.810 --> 09:09.490
So just on the surface, what's new surface?

09:11.730 --> 09:12.960
Pass a modifier.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.200
Jesse Tulip for snow padding.

09:30.890 --> 09:32.270
And let's add.

09:37.090 --> 09:39.550
The shape, because the one that circle shape.

09:43.150 --> 09:47.110
Passing a color that's color I want.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.980
Then inside, that's why I'm going to pass on the text, right?

09:54.220 --> 10:03.400
And it's going to be a favorite that country hopes a country like this and its paths, of course, a

10:03.400 --> 10:04.360
modifier.

10:08.120 --> 10:16.660
I'm going to give a padding overall for deep and give a style material theme

10:19.420 --> 10:21.910
topography, say caption like this.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.860
OK, so we're done with this part.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.990
Now we're going to look at this.

10:29.470 --> 10:29.860
There.

10:32.950 --> 10:34.750
So I'm going to go outside, of course.

10:35.800 --> 10:43.300
Let's see, you have this structure there and created this row to remove that.

10:43.330 --> 10:46.000
So right after that, I'm going to create another icon.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.170
She was different there.

11:00.740 --> 11:01.610
I want to delete.

11:05.350 --> 11:08.230
It's just personal, actually, let's just say delete.

11:14.850 --> 11:15.980
Pass a modifier.

11:20.050 --> 11:21.310
I want this to be clickable.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.890
It's very important.

11:24.580 --> 11:30.160
And also, I want to pass it tint colour to change things a little bit when I say colour.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.770
Read and change of things, a little bit of.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.780
0.3 F.

11:42.380 --> 11:42.740
OK.

11:44.940 --> 11:49.440
Now, what do we want to happen when we click on this button?

11:49.470 --> 11:50.440
It's very simple.

11:50.490 --> 11:53.520
All I want to do is delete that favorite city.

11:54.060 --> 11:59.460
Serving as a favorite view model, dot, delete and pass our favorite object.

12:00.570 --> 12:06.450
Look how simple this is now, because we've structured everything again to emphasize everything is well

12:06.450 --> 12:06.960
structured.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.850
We have the lower part repository view model and so forth.

12:09.850 --> 12:18.950
So now at the top level of everything, it's so much easier to use what we've worked so hard for, huh?

12:19.010 --> 12:25.860
So just delete past that favorite object, which we know has been passed along in our city row and we're

12:25.860 --> 12:26.130
done.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.530
And the great thing now here is that while in fact, let's just run, this will wait to see if we're

12:31.530 --> 12:37.950
going to see something right because we've been looking to we've been working on the favorite for a

12:37.950 --> 12:38.340
while.

12:39.990 --> 12:44.880
Let's run this and hopefully make sure we can see something.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.460
All right, so let's go to our favorites.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.600
We can do that by clicking favorites.

12:52.650 --> 12:53.220
Aha.

12:53.820 --> 12:59.010
Just like that, we see San Diego, Seattle, Moscow, these are the cities we have added it before.

12:59.640 --> 13:04.410
How wonderful, in fact, because the elite is already there, I can click and voila, it's gone.

13:05.100 --> 13:09.660
If I go back, of course, say San Diego here, of course, that was the last thing we had.

13:10.020 --> 13:11.310
I can add something else.

13:11.310 --> 13:13.950
Let's say Rio de Janeiro.

13:17.070 --> 13:18.300
Hopefully you get something.

13:18.600 --> 13:18.940
All right.

13:19.110 --> 13:22.000
Janeiro, Brazil, that's saved.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.620
I know this is saved now.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.270
Good favorites.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.590
You should see a different era.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.770
And Brazil, it's there.

13:28.790 --> 13:29.660
All right, very good.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.220
It's working now.

13:31.280 --> 13:37.760
It is that when we click on this structure here, the whole thing, right, the whole room want to be

13:37.760 --> 13:41.700
able to go back to Maine and whatever now was clicked.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.350
We are going to repopulate this main screen here with that new city.

13:46.310 --> 13:46.950
What do we do that?

13:46.970 --> 13:49.670
Well, first of all, we have enough control in our city.

13:50.540 --> 13:54.500
And we're going to call that somewhere while we call that inside of this surface.

13:54.500 --> 14:01.070
Because remember, this is a surface that is this whole surface there.

14:01.630 --> 14:01.910
Right?

14:02.420 --> 14:04.220
So when that is clicked, we want to do something.

14:07.040 --> 14:12.950
Yes, we say nav controller and then we say navigate.

14:13.010 --> 14:14.750
Remember, we get the correct one.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.550
They were out strange like this.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.290
And here we pass the route.

14:18.440 --> 14:27.620
So we're going to use the weather screens these that's the, you know, and I'm going to go to main

14:28.220 --> 14:29.530
screen name.

14:30.050 --> 14:31.640
But look how wonderful this is.

14:31.670 --> 14:35.860
Remember, when we go to main screen, we have to pass a variable.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.250
In this case, we have passed to see.

14:38.270 --> 14:42.500
Which happens to be the city that we have right now set up for us.

14:42.530 --> 14:42.800
Right.

14:43.730 --> 14:52.980
So I'm going to say something like that and then passing the variable, which is our favorite dad city

14:53.810 --> 14:54.320
like that.

14:56.430 --> 15:00.870
That's right, because this favorite object here is what's being passed, you know, a single row,

15:01.110 --> 15:06.990
which in this case is going to be that favorite that we got from our favorite the view model.

15:07.860 --> 15:15.930
Like we look through the list to create this lazy column, which is this that shows they're right.

15:17.220 --> 15:21.390
And now we have access to each individual object because that's passed along, you know, see, the

15:21.390 --> 15:26.850
row in this case is the favorite, and we can use that to get the city.

15:27.980 --> 15:33.560
To navigate, to weather the main screen, and then we should pass in the new city.

15:34.610 --> 15:42.200
And just to for a reminder and we say main screen, you notice that main screen needs that information,

15:43.110 --> 15:43.360
right?

15:43.370 --> 15:45.860
We still have that log d there.

15:46.160 --> 15:53.390
But he needs this city for navigation because we passed the city name into our get weather data on another

15:53.390 --> 15:57.320
view model in our produce state, which drives everything here.

15:59.690 --> 16:00.050
All right.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.310
Let's see if this works.

16:05.020 --> 16:05.430
OK.

16:05.730 --> 16:06.350
Let's see.

16:06.370 --> 16:12.040
I'm going to go to favorites and let's say San Diego, click.

16:12.160 --> 16:12.580
Voila!

16:12.700 --> 16:16.640
San Diego is showing and it's showing everything about San Diego.

16:16.870 --> 16:19.090
Seven day everything works right.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.590
Because all that drives everything is our get weather data.

16:23.590 --> 16:28.360
We pass the city name, which we receive from our route.

16:30.300 --> 16:33.810
From what I from our out, our navigation arguments.

16:35.730 --> 16:41.640
All right, if I change this good favorites again, I want to read Jane Eyre again, click through airways

16:41.640 --> 16:46.290
showing I go, I want Seattle this time.

16:46.650 --> 16:49.620
And voila, there are a few things we need to do.

16:49.920 --> 16:55.440
Specifically, we see here that even though Seattle comes from, it's part of a favorite.

16:56.160 --> 17:02.550
They give us the option to still like this or still favor this seat, which is not what we want.

17:02.550 --> 17:06.330
So we want to be able to check, first of all, whenever we come here.

17:06.360 --> 17:12.900
Our main screen to check, to see if the city we are on right now, if that's the city, it's contained

17:12.900 --> 17:17.610
in our database and we're going to hide this because it makes no sense to show these ratings just like,

17:17.610 --> 17:22.080
well, we already have that city, so we don't need to save it again, even though if we try to save

17:22.080 --> 17:29.640
again with the strategy we have in our database table and so forth, we said that if it's the same item,

17:29.640 --> 17:30.690
we can always override it.

17:30.690 --> 17:35.340
But even though that's true, but this is just not good user experience.

17:35.340 --> 17:42.000
So we're going to hide that depending whether or not we have, that's already in our database.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.620
So that's what we're going to be doing next.

WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:01.660
All this work dead now.

00:01.680 --> 00:06.300
You notice that there is no way for us to really get rid of the keyboard.

00:06.330 --> 00:08.130
Of course, you can click here and goes away.

00:08.550 --> 00:15.840
But I want to be able to when I'm writing here, when we hit done or check mark down here, we want

00:15.840 --> 00:20.820
to be able to get rid of our keyboard so we can focus on whatever else we have in there.

00:21.300 --> 00:25.860
Well, luckily we can do that because we have our keyboard controller.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.380
So when is that going to happen or when do we use this keyboard controller to hide our keyboard?

00:31.770 --> 00:35.400
Well, that's going to happen right after I was submit button.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.910
Or actually, I should say when the submit button is clicked.

00:40.170 --> 00:47.730
So here, right after we have on done is sent via email and the passwords are sent over again, say

00:47.730 --> 00:48.330
keyboard.

00:49.850 --> 00:53.570
Controller and then not hide like this.

00:54.560 --> 01:01.490
Of course, we have to go ahead and surround with Noel, check or replace with safe call like this.

01:01.790 --> 01:02.330
And voila!

01:03.230 --> 01:05.090
OK, now who run this?

01:06.950 --> 01:10.850
And I put something gibberish there and there are gibberish.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.920
Go ahead and say, log in.

01:12.980 --> 01:15.190
Notice the moment we said, log in.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.840
This goes away, which is exactly what we want.

01:19.220 --> 01:19.460
All right.

01:19.460 --> 01:24.110
So now we are going to look at the sign up, right logic.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.120
So let me look, let me show you what that will look like.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.800
So the sign up will be something like this.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.260
So there are a few differences, but the main thing here is that we'll have the same structure.

01:36.440 --> 01:43.130
So this is why we've set up things the way we've set up because we want to be able to check if the user

01:43.130 --> 01:47.570
is clicking or the user in this case is trying to log in.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.130
You notice the difference here.

01:49.130 --> 01:53.180
Actually put this together side by side you see here, says new user.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.860
Sign up, they click Sign up.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.840
This should show, right?

01:57.230 --> 02:03.500
And then it's going to also change to log in because in this case, they can revert back to log in screen.

02:03.980 --> 02:07.490
So we're going to do this real quick so that we have this option here now.

02:07.490 --> 02:10.820
We could have created a total different screen for each one of these.

02:11.060 --> 02:18.780
But this is actually clever and the best way to do this, because then we can reuse these components

02:18.800 --> 02:21.650
with these composable and show them on the same screen.

02:22.130 --> 02:22.430
OK.

02:23.270 --> 02:23.570
All right.

02:23.630 --> 02:25.040
OK, let's go ahead and do this.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.860
So inside of a reader, log in.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.470
This is where we calling our user form.

02:31.310 --> 02:39.440
And outside there, I'm just going to create a variable called show log in form, and it's going to

02:39.440 --> 02:40.210
be a remember.

02:40.210 --> 02:42.860
I can use this savable like this.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.460
And get rid of all of that.

02:48.330 --> 02:51.420
In this case, it's going to be a mutable state of.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.420
And let's give it true first.

02:55.560 --> 02:55.840
OK.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.180
To say that in the beginning is going to be true to show the log in form.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.860
Let's put this in one line.

03:04.810 --> 03:09.080
They're now inside here.

03:09.380 --> 03:14.780
Before we even at this point, we're just showing the user form, but again, we want to check to see

03:15.110 --> 03:19.490
if we want to show the user form or not.

03:19.880 --> 03:23.540
So I'm going to wrap all of this inside of if statement.

03:23.540 --> 03:28.370
So if and show log in form, it's a mutable state song.

03:28.370 --> 03:29.240
I say value.

03:30.200 --> 03:36.920
If it's true, then I'm going to say, of course, this is going to be valid to show this show user

03:36.920 --> 03:37.310
form.

03:37.310 --> 03:37.940
And that's good.

03:38.720 --> 03:38.990
OK.

03:41.060 --> 03:44.900
And let me get rid of all of this for now, because we no longer need that.

03:46.870 --> 03:48.650
We'll work later there.

03:49.370 --> 03:49.670
All right.

03:49.670 --> 03:57.680
So else if that's another case, meaning that the show log in for show lagging form is not true.

03:58.130 --> 04:05.540
That means we want to show the, I'm going to say user form, but now we're going to pass a different

04:06.080 --> 04:07.280
set of arguments.

04:07.730 --> 04:11.630
First of all, the loading in this case, I'm going to say it's going to be false.

04:12.060 --> 04:12.440
Right?

04:13.280 --> 04:19.730
And then is create a count now is going to be true because we no longer we're going to be showing the.

04:21.050 --> 04:25.100
The log in this is going to be create a council user, create account.

04:25.610 --> 04:26.390
It's going to be true.

04:30.530 --> 04:34.610
And then here, of course, we're going to have the same thing where we had there, so I'm going to

04:34.610 --> 04:36.860
just copy all of that.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.570
This is our trailing lambada.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.660
OK, so here is what I'm going to do the work.

04:42.680 --> 04:48.080
We're not there yet because we need to create, account, say to do create.

04:49.850 --> 05:02.300
AFB for Firebase, I count this, and in our case here, we are going to also say to do half the logging

05:02.650 --> 05:04.880
in AFB for Firebase, not Facebook.

05:06.410 --> 05:06.800
Very good.

05:07.010 --> 05:12.470
So we're still inside of all of our reader log in screen, so we still here, by the way.

05:12.860 --> 05:14.150
So what do we need to do next?

05:14.180 --> 05:17.570
Well, next, we're going to create this structure here.

05:17.630 --> 05:24.290
Yes, because we want to give the users the chance to say, Well, if you can't log in because you don't

05:24.290 --> 05:26.140
have an account, we can go ahead and sign up.

05:26.150 --> 05:29.390
So it's created this, well, I'm going to go down.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.150
So right outside of.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.750
Our column, right, so right there, I'm going to put Errol.

05:39.220 --> 05:45.310
Actually, sir, with a space service, I want to give some space between somebody's fire when I give

05:45.310 --> 05:47.390
a height of about 15 dpi.

05:47.860 --> 05:48.120
OK?

05:48.910 --> 05:50.470
And then let's add a row.

05:51.340 --> 06:01.000
So in this row here, I'm going to pass a modifier as well as a modifier modifier and give it padding,

06:01.420 --> 06:05.710
and it's going to be about 15 dpi overall padding.

06:07.030 --> 06:10.090
And let's say horizontal arrangement.

06:10.720 --> 06:17.080
I want this to be center and vertical alignment.

06:17.350 --> 06:19.540
I'm going to be also center vertically.

06:20.320 --> 06:20.620
All right.

06:20.710 --> 06:23.410
So we are going to create this structure there.

06:23.740 --> 06:28.870
It's going to be a row because you have to text once it's user the I want, they sign up.

06:32.260 --> 06:40.300
Now I'm going to say foul text here and this text is going to contain some values, depending on the

06:40.300 --> 06:40.900
situation.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.370
So you see, earlier it was showing you depending where we are.

06:46.030 --> 06:52.030
All things considered, we can show sign up if we are talking about logging in because the user can

06:52.030 --> 06:55.050
say, Well, I can't log in because I don't have a log in or I have an account.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.360
In that case, I will have to create an account so they can go to sign up.

06:58.810 --> 07:04.480
But if they are in the logging page, well, it is the same page or it is the same screen with just

07:04.480 --> 07:06.790
swiping things here, the logic, right?

07:07.360 --> 07:11.980
And so then they will have access to the log in because they want to go back to this logging because

07:11.980 --> 07:13.240
they can't, right?

07:13.240 --> 07:14.440
They already have an account.

07:15.410 --> 07:16.730
OK, so that is the case.

07:16.730 --> 07:18.760
So I'm going to put that in a variable.

07:18.760 --> 07:25.480
The text that is put out instead of if statement and it will save show log in form, that value is true.

07:25.840 --> 07:32.800
Well, in that case, the text we're going to add is going to say, sign up like this else.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.770
Well, that means we going to see log in.

07:36.430 --> 07:43.840
Next, I'm going to add a text here, and I'm going to say new user like this.

07:45.850 --> 07:53.320
And they want to create another text that will then have our text that we passed at the top, this one.

07:54.130 --> 07:54.390
OK.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.540
And because they have the same name, I can just remove the argument name and this works.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.960
Let's pass a modifier here.

08:09.520 --> 08:14.560
We're going to make this, first of all, clickable, because remember, I want this to be clickable

08:14.560 --> 08:18.790
so that when they click, they can go to the create account and vice versa.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.370
That's the beauty here with a modifier, we can make anything clickable.

08:23.850 --> 08:31.050
So when this is clickable, what we want to do, we actually want to change the value of our show log

08:31.050 --> 08:39.240
in form because that is what is going to determined whether or not we want to show this or this.

08:41.200 --> 08:41.860
Does it make sense?

08:42.250 --> 08:45.340
OK, we'll see that someone said show log in form and remember.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.470
Let's go.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.940
So again, show log in for me.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.200
See, this is a mutable state.

08:49.210 --> 08:54.730
We did this on purpose because we wanted to have that state and we can then pass it around.

08:54.730 --> 08:58.050
And then the composable is going to react, right?

08:58.060 --> 09:00.340
Recompose, according to this new state.

09:01.390 --> 09:01.740
All right.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.650
So show log form that value.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.990
We're going to toggle it right between true and false.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.910
So we put the exclamation point and then show log in form value again

09:15.130 --> 09:15.420
section.

09:15.910 --> 09:21.130
So you click it first time it's going to, if it sign up, are going to change to log in if you click

09:21.130 --> 09:21.430
back.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.660
It's going to change to sign up.

09:23.170 --> 09:29.170
And while that happens, we can also check obviously later to see what is the value of show logging.

09:29.170 --> 09:30.790
And in fact, we've done that already.

09:31.150 --> 09:32.560
So we have this logic here.

09:32.560 --> 09:40.400
If this true the show log in, then we know that we need to, then we know we need to log in the user.

09:40.840 --> 09:45.970
Else we're going to show that form, but we're going to have some things that are different and we are

09:45.970 --> 09:46.750
going to create the user.

09:47.530 --> 09:57.190
OK, so let's pass it padding and start on about five dpi.

09:58.690 --> 10:02.080
So I'm going to give this padding from left to right.

10:02.440 --> 10:07.300
Give that space there and fight.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.240
Wait, Seybold.

10:12.930 --> 10:22.650
And passing a color material theme colors and let's say, secondary variant.

10:23.460 --> 10:23.640
OK.

10:27.490 --> 10:31.900
All right, let's see if our logic works because we have been working for a little bit.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.800
Let's run this.

10:35.820 --> 10:37.680
OK, there go our entry.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.060
And voila!

10:39.240 --> 10:40.140
This is very nice.

10:40.230 --> 10:41.310
Looks good.

10:41.370 --> 10:43.360
Now if I click on, sign up.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.840
Aha, you see, it's changed the create account.

10:46.290 --> 10:49.020
If I go back to log in, then it's going to change the log.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.370
This is good, right?

10:50.610 --> 10:54.120
Because now we are in log in page per se.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.710
That means the user can log in, right?

10:56.790 --> 11:01.290
But if they realize I can't log in because I don't have an account, they can go ahead and sign up and

11:01.290 --> 11:05.880
we change the button to create a account, which means then whatever happens here, it's going to be

11:05.880 --> 11:08.160
taken for creating an account.

11:08.910 --> 11:14.310
Now to finalize also notice we have this text that we need to add as well, depending on the situation.

11:14.310 --> 11:17.220
So when we creating account, we do have this text here.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.530
Let's go ahead and add that text before we move forward.

11:20.460 --> 11:27.230
So inside of our user form, because this text is going to be attached to the user form, right?

11:28.140 --> 11:29.760
Let's go and add.

11:30.270 --> 11:31.200
So in our column?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.570
Here, right on top.

11:36.620 --> 11:37.490
I'm going to say if.

11:40.000 --> 11:48.340
Is Create account is true, then the text that I'm going to show you here now, I can add the text directly,

11:48.340 --> 11:55.930
but I can also add all of that in our resources so I can say resource string a resource such in past

11:55.940 --> 11:57.460
aid and when they are God.

11:59.490 --> 12:08.640
Strains that in this case, I probably have to import to the R class, so have access to the resources.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.400
And this add apt name.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.030
But that's not where we want, but there it is.

12:14.040 --> 12:18.810
Let's go ahead and click and here I'm going to actually create another string.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.330
Remember, here is the strings that smell.

12:21.330 --> 12:25.560
This is where you want to add all the strings that will be part of your application.

12:25.560 --> 12:31.110
So it's a really good idea because then if you want, for instance, to create a different version of

12:31.110 --> 12:34.450
these strings in four different languages, it's easier to have in one place.

12:34.530 --> 12:39.900
So this is the recommended wait on the string and then the name here is going to be,

12:42.840 --> 12:49.410
as you say, create a city like this and I have the text and it's going to say something like.

12:51.040 --> 12:56.800
Please enter a valid email and password.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.560
That is.

13:03.310 --> 13:04.150
At least.

13:10.630 --> 13:18.220
Six characters are S. So now they have it in our string that accept mail.

13:18.250 --> 13:21.270
By the way, all of that is actually down here.

13:21.280 --> 13:26.560
If you go to resources, you go to values, go to strings SML example.

13:27.430 --> 13:34.870
So now in here, I can go ahead and get that string, which is create a account, I believe.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.390
Yeah, great act like that.

13:38.470 --> 13:40.950
It's much easier this way and cleaner.

13:40.960 --> 13:47.110
And so I can pass a style while it's actually passing modifier here.

13:48.390 --> 13:54.760
All right, at fire, I'm going to give it padding around over about four dpi.

13:55.630 --> 14:01.090
OK, so if that's the case, this is the tax we're going to show else else.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.730
I'm just going to have a text that is empty like this.

14:04.360 --> 14:09.370
So the idea is that if we are in the create account, we're going to see this message.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.370
Otherwise, it's just going to not have anything.

14:14.120 --> 14:14.530
OK.

14:14.900 --> 14:20.780
All right, let's go ahead and run this quick so we can see the fruits of our work.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.250
Ha ha.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.490
Looks like we have some issues here.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.750
Looks like right here we are.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.040
Log in.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.380
Yes, because we're using some of the.

14:36.840 --> 14:45.210
Experimental compose uses, so it requires us to add that as well, so I'm going to add that to the

14:45.210 --> 14:48.180
reader in navigation altogether, so we can see that is out of there.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.330
So that's what's needed and we're going to run again.

14:52.740 --> 14:54.390
Hopefully now things should work.

14:56.410 --> 15:03.010
Yes, we need to do that again, because everywhere you call a composable that require that experimental

15:03.010 --> 15:07.180
compose you are, you would need to pass that along, which is a little bit annoying if you ask me,

15:07.180 --> 15:09.940
because we should just be able to call it once and be good.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.190
But that's what we have right now.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.230
So we just have to deal with it.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.160
It's fine again.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.160
Hopefully, this time should be good.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.490
Yes, we have.

15:21.810 --> 15:23.160
This is what I'm talking about.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.620
All right, let's do that again.

15:25.950 --> 15:26.430
Thank you.

15:26.460 --> 15:32.220
Google, let's add this to the main activity as such and this one one more time.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.970
OK, it looks like this time will should be good.

15:38.380 --> 15:42.670
And there you have it, that nice animation, and voila.

15:42.730 --> 15:43.030
Good.

15:43.330 --> 15:46.200
OK, let's see if this works, so sign up wildlife.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.110
Please enter a valid email and password.

15:48.130 --> 15:51.610
Eight At least six characters I could log in and I see nothing.

15:54.500 --> 16:00.950
Now, look how wonderful this is, so you remember earlier we actually added this form inside of a scrollable,

16:01.250 --> 16:10.850
because exactly this depending on how things are set up, we say that this area here, we added, gave

16:10.850 --> 16:12.320
it a certain height.

16:12.680 --> 16:20.660
Now the moment that we add more than what we want, more than more than what this area can take, it

16:20.660 --> 16:22.000
gives us that squirrel ability.

16:22.010 --> 16:26.030
So this is very helpful, especially if we have more information.

16:26.030 --> 16:27.860
So now use users can scroll up and see.

16:27.980 --> 16:33.230
Of course, it looks a little tacky in our case here because it doesn't really make much sense or it

16:33.230 --> 16:34.190
looks just terrible.

16:34.490 --> 16:40.730
But if you had more, say more feel that he had to deal with and so forth, so you can see that this

16:40.820 --> 16:42.100
will be very helpful, OK?

16:42.350 --> 16:44.480
So just wanted to point that one out.

16:44.990 --> 16:48.800
But yes, things are working and this is very nice.

16:49.130 --> 16:57.410
So the main idea here to take away is that we could have created different pages or different screens,

16:57.410 --> 17:03.170
but that's just not necessary because we were using all of our composable, which is exactly what do

17:03.170 --> 17:04.040
you need to be doing?

17:04.220 --> 17:07.370
You can't reuse your code, so you don't have to repeat yourself.

17:08.000 --> 17:08.300
Right?

17:08.690 --> 17:15.050
So this is really nice because now, depending on the situation, if I go back to my code, I will know

17:15.050 --> 17:17.150
exactly what need to happen, what needs to happen.

17:17.630 --> 17:20.570
Let's go to reader login screen where we call it.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.030
Here is where the magic happens.

17:23.450 --> 17:28.460
So now, depending on who's situation, whether the login form is true, that is being shown, we're

17:28.460 --> 17:31.490
going to go ahead and write the code that will log in the user.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.150
Otherwise, this person is actually wanting to create an account.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.550
So we're going to write a code to create that account.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.040
All of that using this same form.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.020
How cool is that?

17:42.030 --> 17:49.130
You should be very happy and excited because you've just created something that is very useful and I'm

17:49.130 --> 17:49.880
happy for you.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.430
All right, thank you.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.790
I'll see you next.

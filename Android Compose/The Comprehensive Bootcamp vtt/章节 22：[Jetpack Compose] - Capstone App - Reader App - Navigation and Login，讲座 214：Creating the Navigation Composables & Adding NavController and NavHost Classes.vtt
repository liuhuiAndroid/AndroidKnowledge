00:00.660 --> 00:05.820
So now that we have a readers screen class who knows how to route everything.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.900
Let's go ahead and look at creating the navigation so this go ahead to read on navigation.

00:13.590 --> 00:14.160
So we do.

00:14.160 --> 00:20.010
Navigation will allow, of course, for us to be able to put together the screens and innovations so

00:20.010 --> 00:23.130
that we're able to then go from one screen to the next.

00:23.610 --> 00:23.820
Right.

00:24.810 --> 00:25.890
So what do we need to do here?

00:26.010 --> 00:28.620
Well, first of all, this has to be a composable.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.650
In fact, this is not a class.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.720
It's going to be fun like this function.

00:34.230 --> 00:40.170
And let's say composable such a. function.

00:40.170 --> 00:43.350
We have to put the parentheses there.

00:43.950 --> 00:44.250
OK.

00:44.760 --> 00:48.330
The first thing we need is to add a nav controller.

00:48.330 --> 00:58.770
So say foul nav controller, such if Hey NAV controller, and then I'm going to use the Remember NAV

00:58.830 --> 01:05.010
controller like this because we need to have control over this nav controller will be able to direct

01:05.190 --> 01:11.240
where we need to go so we can say enough controller that go to X Root, right?

01:11.910 --> 01:12.600
So we need that.

01:13.860 --> 01:20.160
But for all of that, we also need a place where we can host all of the composable in this case, all

01:20.160 --> 01:21.120
of the screens.

01:21.720 --> 01:28.830
Well, for that will need a nav hosts on there, say nav host such and we need to pass the nav controller,

01:28.830 --> 01:33.690
which is created right because it needs and then we need to create the graph here that will contain

01:33.690 --> 01:35.310
all of the screens, all the composable.

01:35.310 --> 01:39.180
So we are building here the actual screens.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.430
Now I'm not going to put graphs like this.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.380
I'm actually going to add a start, say start destination.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.810
OK, so we need to have a starting point.

01:49.170 --> 01:55.440
Here is the beauty why we went through the trouble to create this reader screen.

01:55.440 --> 02:01.650
So let's see, go back to our readers screens there because we can have one place where we add all of

02:01.650 --> 02:09.180
our screens and the connections in the paths right for our screens so we can use that here.

02:10.050 --> 02:15.780
So starting this nation, I could have just put something like Hello world or.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.040
Log in screen like this.

02:20.170 --> 02:21.840
But this is not very scalable.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.180
That's why we have the rear screens.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.290
Look what I can do.

02:25.290 --> 02:31.410
I can say readers screens, right, and I can go to splash screen.

02:32.790 --> 02:36.300
That's what I want to get to that name, right?

02:36.840 --> 02:41.880
So I'm passing the name of my destination, that has to be the starting point.

02:43.530 --> 02:43.920
All right.

02:44.130 --> 02:48.690
And of course, this is a lambda, I can go ahead and do that.

02:49.290 --> 02:52.410
And now I have inside here the nav graph builder.

02:52.410 --> 02:59.880
So this is where I build the graph, meaning the actual composable or the actual screens that I want

02:59.880 --> 03:00.780
to show you the user.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.340
So how do we create that composable destination or screen composable?

03:05.340 --> 03:05.820
That is.

03:06.390 --> 03:07.860
And let's start again.

03:07.860 --> 03:08.820
I just want to show you something.

03:08.820 --> 03:11.180
So I say composable notice here.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.860
It says we need to pass a route and arguments.

03:13.890 --> 03:14.810
We'll see that later.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.180
OK, so there we go for a composable here, I need to pass the route.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.650
Well, what is the route?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.380
Meaning where is it that I want to go?

03:22.890 --> 03:31.440
Well, I want to go to a screen which I can get from a reader again, screens right that I'm going to

03:31.440 --> 03:33.240
go to a splash screen.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.800
OK, that name like this.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.590
And then, of course, I do have the.

03:41.630 --> 03:45.110
Nap backs, snack entry, which an object that we will talk about.

03:45.440 --> 03:51.290
So in this case here, then inside of these composable, you know, a lambda here, this is where I

03:51.290 --> 03:53.780
pass the actual screen.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.970
In this case, I'm going to say reader splash screen.

03:59.120 --> 03:59.920
Notice the difference here.

03:59.930 --> 04:04.220
Now I'm actually invoking the screen, the composable screen we created earlier.

04:04.760 --> 04:10.790
And for this, I'm going to pass along the NAF controller because I want to make sure that I'm able

04:10.940 --> 04:17.900
to invoke or get the INAF controller and get the user the opportunity to if they wish to.

04:17.900 --> 04:20.450
So to go to a different screen if they want to.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.890
That's why I'm going to pass along this NAF controller that I created up here.

04:25.370 --> 04:32.360
Now this is read here because if we go to our readers splash screen command, click See that we don't

04:32.750 --> 04:34.520
pass the nav controller.

04:34.790 --> 04:35.570
So I need here.

04:35.570 --> 04:41.300
I'm going to say nav controller like that and pass that along.

04:41.870 --> 04:47.050
All of these composable look at them as the screens are going to be inside of nav host and that we have

04:47.060 --> 04:52.010
the director we still have, which is the nav controller, because we can then say now have control

04:52.100 --> 04:53.990
dot, go to X and so forth.

04:54.230 --> 04:57.530
So it makes it really easy to conceptualize this idea of navigation here.

04:57.770 --> 05:02.390
So I can do the same, of course, to others do a couple more.

05:02.390 --> 05:08.450
In this case, I'm going to go create another one for reader home screen like this and of course, on,

05:08.450 --> 05:09.920
let's say, reader home.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.100
Or I think I call it home screen.

05:16.210 --> 05:16.670
Very good.

05:16.750 --> 05:23.470
It's going to have the same issue because I need to pass that knife controller, which we can do now,

05:23.470 --> 05:24.580
have controller.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.730
There we go and go back.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.310
And the problem is over.

05:30.640 --> 05:37.120
So as a little exercise, I want you to do the same for the search screen.

05:37.570 --> 05:42.820
Do the same for all other screens that we are going to have or we have created earlier here.

05:42.820 --> 05:43.630
So it's really simple.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.850
Just want to make sure that you get the hang of it.

05:46.360 --> 05:46.630
OK.

05:47.170 --> 05:50.020
Go ahead and do that and I'll see you next.
